After reviewing the LendingLedger contract in detail, no functions were found to be missing proper access control checks. Here’s a summary of the analysis:

1. Functions that update sensitive or “governance‐only” state (setRewards and whiteListLendingMarket) are protected with the onlyGovernance modifier.
2. The sync_ledger function is designed to be called only by lending market contracts and properly checks that msg.sender is on the lendingMarketWhitelist.
3. The claim function computes rewards based on mappings that are updated only via sync_ledger (which itself enforces a whitelist check) and uses msg.sender as the lender. There is no way for a user to claim rewards for markets where they have not deposited.
4. The checkpoint_market and checkpoint_lender functions are externally callable by anyone; however, they only update historical checkpoint data based on existing deposits (verified by require statements) and do not expose any sensitive state modifications that could be exploited.

Based on this detailed review, no access control issues have been detected in any of the functions provided.
