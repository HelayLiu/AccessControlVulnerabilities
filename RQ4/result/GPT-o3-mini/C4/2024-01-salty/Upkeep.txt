Below is one potential issue found in the contract regarding access control:

1. Vulnerable Function: performUpkeep (approximately lines 140–160)  
 Reason: The performUpkeep function is fully public and does not include an access control check restricting which addresses may invoke it. (Certain keepers may be intended to execute upkeep work.) Instead, the contract relies on each internal “step” function (step1–step11) to use the onlySameContract modifier so that they can only be invoked from within the contract itself. This design means that any external account may call performUpkeep and, in doing so, trigger a full suite of operations that include transferring rewards (in step2) and releasing vested amounts (in steps 10–11). In effect, if the protocol’s design was meant to restrict who may trigger these costly operations, an attacker (or any arbitrary actor) could repeatedly call performUpkeep and capture the caller’s reward from the arbitrage withdrawals (or trigger vesting releases) even if that were not the intended behavior. (A proof‐of‐concept would simply be an externally owned account calling performUpkeep and receiving the 5% reward from step2 for each call.) 

Note: In many “upkeep” designs it is intentional to let anyone trigger maintenance steps (provided all the underlying sub‐contracts expect it) so that the system remains “permissionless” and economically self‐incentivized. However, if the intended design were to restrict these calls to an approved set of keepers (or at least to prevent abuse of the reward flows), then the lack of an explicit access control on performUpkeep constitutes an access control issue.
