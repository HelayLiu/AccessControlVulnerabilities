After a detailed review of the UlyssesRouter contract, no functions or state changes were found that expose the contract to unintended privilege escalation. In brief:

1. All externally callable functions (addLiquidity, removeLiquidity, swap) are designed to be public endpoints for end users to interact with the pools. They perform minimal internal lookups (via getUlyssesLP) and then call the corresponding pool methods.
2. The getUlyssesLP function is marked as private and is only used internally to retrieve and cache pool addresses from the factory. It reverts if the pool id is unrecognized, ensuring that only valid pools are used.
3. There are no administrative or privileged functions that allow a caller to change sensitive state (such as modifying pool mappings or critical configuration variables) in a way that would grant unauthorized control.
4. The allowance-setting (safeApprove) in getUlyssesLP is executed immediately after verifying that the pool address is valid, and it is not exposed to external caller manipulation.
5. The ulyssesFactory variable is set once in the constructor and is not mutable, so there is no risk of an attacker changing the factory reference.

Based on the above points, there are no access control issues in this contract. Every externally callable function is intended to be open to users (in the context of a router) and appropriately validates inputs before proceeding.
