1. Function transferOwnership in the Ownable contract  
   Location: Approximately line 37–43 (depending on formatting)  
   Reason: Unlike other owner‐changing functions (e.g. renounceOwnership, lock) that include the onlyOwner modifier, transferOwnership is missing an access control check. This omission allows any external account to call transferOwnership and reassign ownership (provided the new owner address is not the zero address), which can lead to unauthorized control of the contract.
