After a detailed review of the contract, I did not identify any functions that lack the proper access control checks. All administrative and sensitive state‐modifying functions—for example, setting fee percentages (setTaxFeePercent, setDevFeePercent, setBurnFeePercent), changing the maximum transaction percentage (setMaxTxPercent), disabling/enabling fees (disableFees/enableFees) and managing the developer wallet (setDevWalletAddress, replaceDevWalletAddress)—are protected by the onlyOwner modifier. Standard ERC20 functions such as transfer, approve, and transferFrom operate as expected without requiring additional access‐control since they follow the ERC20 standard and users can only move tokens they own.

Minor design points (such as using a separate tokenOwner for initial distribution while the contract’s administrative owner remains the deployer, or the absence of a non-zero check in setDevWalletAddress) appear intentional or are logic/design choices rather than access control vulnerabilities.

Therefore, no public function is missing necessary access control, and no access control issues were found in the provided contract code.
