After a detailed review of the contract’s public and external functions, we did not find any functions that erroneously allow an unauthorized user to call a sensitive operation. In summary:

1. All administrative functions (setBaseURI, setMiner, setsoilAddress, setGSDAddress, setLFTAddress, setExtension, setPaused, and the Ownable‑inherited ownership functions) are protected by the onlyOwner modifier.
2. The mint function is protected by a custom onlyMiner modifier (and onlyOwner can designate addresses as “miner”), so only approved accounts can mint.
3. The upgrade function—which calls external token transfers—is restricted to the owner of the token (it checks ownerOf(_tokenId)==msg.sender) and further restricts contract calls by requiring msg.sender == tx.origin. Although the lack of a nonReentrant modifier might be noted from a reentrancy‐perspective (which is a separate class of issues), in terms of access control the upgrade function correctly restricts usage to token owners.
4. Other view functions (e.g. tokenURI, gethistoryList, getLevel) do not need access control since they only return public state.

Therefore, based on our analysis there are no access control issues in the provided file.

No vulnerable function (with respect to access control) was identified.
