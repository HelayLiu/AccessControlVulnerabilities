Below is the analysis and proof‐of‐concept for the detected access control issue:

1. Vulnerable Modifier: onlyOwner (approximately line 26–31)

 • Reason: In the onlyOwner modifier the check is written as:
  require(msg.sender != owner);
  This logic is inverted. Instead of allowing the owner (msg.sender == owner) to execute functions guarded by onlyOwner, it does the opposite—it rejects the owner’s account while allowing all other addresses. In a properly secured contract the check should be require(msg.sender == owner) so that only the owner can access protected functions.

 • Impact & Proof of Concept: Assume in the future a function is added that uses the onlyOwner modifier. For example:

  function mintTokens(uint256 _amount) onlyOwner public {
   // Only the owner should mint tokens.
   _totalSupply += _amount;
   balances[owner] += _amount;
  }

  Due to the inverted check, if the owner calls mintTokens the require(msg.sender != owner) will fail (blocking the legitimate owner), but any non-owner address will pass the modifier check and be able to mint tokens. This turns a critical administrative capability into an open door for unauthorized manipulation of the contract.

• Summary of the Issue:
 – Vulnerable Function/Modifier: onlyOwner (line ~26–31)
 – Reason: The access control logic is inverted (using msg.sender != owner instead of msg.sender == owner), allowing any non-owner to execute functions meant only for the owner while denying the owner access.

It is essential to fix the modifier by changing the require statement to:
  require(msg.sender == owner);
This will restore the intended access control.
