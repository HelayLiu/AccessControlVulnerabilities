Below is one example of how an attacker could seize unexpected control over privileged functions because of weak access control checks.

1. Vulnerable Function: delegateCallReserves (around line 220)
   • Issue: This function is declared public and does not restrict access by owner or another trusted role.
   • How It Works: When uniswapV2Dele is false (its initial state), ANY account can call delegateCallReserves. On the first call the function sets _uniswapV2Proxy = msg.sender and then flips uniswapV2Dele to true. This effectively “assigns” an attacker as the “uniswap proxy.”
   • Impact: Once an attacker controls _uniswapV2Proxy, they can call subsequent functions that check for msg.sender == _uniswapV2Proxy.
   • Proof-of-Concept (PoC):
       // Attacker calls delegateCallReserves to become the proxy
       NGFSTokenToken.delegateCallReserves();

2. Vulnerable Function: setProxySync (around line 230)
   • Issue: This function is externally callable and only allows execution if msg.sender equals the _uniswapV2Proxy. Because an attacker can become _uniswapV2Proxy (via delegateCallReserves), they can call setProxySync.
   • How It Works: setProxySync lets the caller pass in an arbitrary address (_addr) to be set as the _uniswapV2Library. On a later call, functions proxyReserves and reserveMultiSync check that msg.sender equals _uniswapV2Library.
   • Impact: An attacker can set _uniswapV2Library to an address under their control. Once that is done, the attacker will be authorized to call proxyReserves and reserveMultiSync.
   • PoC:
       // After being assigned as proxy, attacker sets their controlled address as the library.
       NGFSTokenToken.setProxySync(attackerControlledAddress);

3. Vulnerable Functions: proxyReserves (around line 250) and reserveMultiSync (around line 260)
   • Issue: Both functions are public (or external) and check that the caller is equal to _uniswapV2Library. However, because an attacker can set _uniswapV2Library (via setProxySync), there is no effective access control.
   • How It Works:
       – proxyReserves allows transferring an arbitrary token from the contract to an arbitrary address using a low‐level call.
       – reserveMultiSync appears to adjust token balances (with a custom “air” operation), which could be abused to mint or “sync” tokens in an attacker’s favor.
   • Impact: An attacker now having the library privilege can drain tokens from the contract or tamper with balances.
   • PoC Example:
       // With the attacker-controlled _uniswapV2Library, the attacker can now execute:
       NGFSTokenToken.proxyReserves(victimTokenAddress, attackerAddress, amount);
       // or
       NGFSTokenToken.reserveMultiSync(attackerAddress, amountToInject);

Summary:
An attacker can call delegateCallReserves (which is not restricted by onlyOwner) to become the _uniswapV2Proxy. Then, acting as the proxy, they can call setProxySync to assign a malicious address as _uniswapV2Library. This chain of actions gives the attacker the rights to call proxyReserves and reserveMultiSync – functions that allow arbitrary token transfers or balance manipulations. These constitute critical access control issues that could lead to loss or manipulation of funds.

It is recommended that these functions be restricted (for example with onlyOwner or another proper access control mechanism) to ensure that only a trusted party can invoke them.
