1. Vulnerable Function: quaker (lines 120–125)
  Reason: The quaker function is public and does not include any access control (such as onlyOwner). As a result, any user can call quaker to reinitialize the token supply, set the owner's address (owner = msg.sender), and assign token balances. This means an attacker can assume ownership of the contract and later call restricted functions (e.g., mint, pullBack), compromising the contract’s integrity.

• Proof of Concept:
  An attacker can simply execute:
   BOMBBA.quaker(attackerWalletAddress);
  which sets msg.sender (the attacker) as the new owner. Once attacker is set as owner, they can execute onlyOwner-protected functions (like mint and pullBack) to manipulate token balances, further compromising the contract.

This lack of proper access control in the quaker function constitutes a severe vulnerability.
