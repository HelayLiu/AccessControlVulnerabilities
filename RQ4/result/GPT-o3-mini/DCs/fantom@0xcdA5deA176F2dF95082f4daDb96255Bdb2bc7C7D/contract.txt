Below is one potential access control issue found in the contract:

1. Vulnerable Function: revokeStrategy (approximately lines 190–210)
 • Issue: The revokeStrategy function is written so that if msg.sender is the same as the strategy address that is being revoked then no role check is performed. In other words, a strategy (or an attacker controlling a contract that has been added as a strategy by the admin) can call revokeStrategy on itself without having to hold a privileged role (for example the GUARDIAN). 
 • Why It Matters: In this design the admin (DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) is the only one allowed to add strategies. However, once a strategy is added the contract lets that very strategy “self‐revoke” its allocation and remove its allocBPS from totalAllocBPS. In some cases an attacker controlling a strategy contract could exploit this bypass to trigger unexpected changes in vault accounting or disrupt the ordering in the withdrawalQueue—even if the intended idea might be to allow a strategy to opt out, bypassing a role check may let a misbehaving (or malicious) strategy manipulate or “game” certain internal parameters.
 • Proof-of-Concept Sketch:
  1. An attacker (or colluding party) is added by the admin as a strategy (with a nonzero allocBPS) into the vault.
  2. The attacker (via the strategy contract, or by controlling it) simply calls revokeStrategy with its own address as the parameter.
  3. Because msg.sender equals the strategy address, the if‑condition bypasses the _atLeastRole(GUARDIAN) check and the function goes on to remove the strategy’s allocation.
  4. This self‑revocation may then be used to disturb how totalAllocBPS and totalAllocated are computed or how funds are withdrawn from the vault.

It is recommended that the contract designers review whether allowing a strategy to unilaterally “revoke” itself is acceptable. If not, then a stricter (role‑restricted) access control should be applied to revokeStrategy regardless of whether the caller is the strategy itself.
