1. Function `renounceOwnership()` (line 66-70) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows the current owner to renounce ownership, which leaves the contract without an owner. This means that any functions restricted to the owner can no longer be called, potentially locking the contract's functionality.

2. Function `transferOwnership(address newOwner)` (line 75-80) has access control issues. Reason: If the `newOwner` address is not properly validated (e.g., it could be a zero address), it could lead to loss of ownership or unintended consequences.

3. Function `pause(bool newPausedPublic, bool newPausedOwnerAdmin)` (line 103-110) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by the owner to change the pause state, but if the owner is compromised, they can pause the contract, preventing all users from interacting with it.

4. Function `setAsCharityAccount(address account)` (line 174-179) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows the owner to set any address as a charity account, which could be exploited if the owner is malicious or compromised.

5. Function `mint(address account, uint256 amount)` (line 215-220) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows the owner to mint new tokens, which could lead to inflation or devaluation of the token if misused.

6. Function `updateFee(uint256 _txFee,uint256 _burnFee,uint256 _charityFee)` (line 205-210) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows the owner to update the fees, which could be exploited to change the economic model of the token in a harmful way.

7. Function `burn(uint256 _value)` (line 182-185) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any user to burn tokens from their own balance without any checks, which could lead to unintended consequences if the user is not careful.

8. Function `excludeAccount(address account)` (line 192-199) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows the owner to exclude any account from receiving fees, which could be exploited to create unfair advantages in the token economy.

9. Function `includeAccount(address account)` (line 201-210) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows the owner to include any account back into the fee structure, which could be exploited to manipulate the token economy.

10. Function `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)` (line 143-146) has access control issues. Reason: This function is subject to the `whenNotPaused` modifier, which could be exploited if the contract is paused by the owner, preventing legitimate transfers.

In summary, the contract has several functions that could lead to access control issues if the owner is compromised or malicious. The functions that allow for ownership transfer, pausing, fee updates, and minting are particularly concerning.
