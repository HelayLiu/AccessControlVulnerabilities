1. Function enablePurchasing() (line 83-86) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any address, but it should only be callable by the owner. This allows unauthorized users to enable purchasing, which could lead to unintended consequences.

2. Function disablePurchasing() (line 88-91) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to enablePurchasing, this function can be called by any address, allowing unauthorized users to disable purchasing, which could disrupt the intended functionality of the contract.

3. Function withdrawForeignTokens(address _tokenContract) (line 93-100) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any address to withdraw foreign tokens from the contract, but it should only be callable by the owner. Unauthorized users could drain tokens from the contract.

4. Function setAIRDROPBounce(uint _newPrice) (line 102-106) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by any address, allowing unauthorized users to change the AIRDROPBounce variable, which could affect the token distribution mechanism.

5. Function setICORatio(uint _newPrice) (line 108-112) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to setAIRDROPBounce, this function can be called by any address, allowing unauthorized users to change the ICORatio variable, which could impact the token issuance rate.

6. Function setMINfinney(uint _newPrice) (line 114-118) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by any address, allowing unauthorized users to change the MINfinney variable, which could affect the minimum contribution amount for purchasing tokens.

7. Function withdraw() (line 120-123) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any address to withdraw the contract's ether balance, but it should only be callable by the owner. Unauthorized users could drain the contract's funds.

In summary, the contract has multiple functions that lack proper access control checks, allowing unauthorized users to perform critical actions that should be restricted to the owner.
