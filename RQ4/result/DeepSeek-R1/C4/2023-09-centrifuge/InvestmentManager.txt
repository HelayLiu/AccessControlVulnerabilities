Okay, let's start by looking at the contract provided. The main contract here is the InvestmentManager, which inherits from Auth. I remember that Auth usually provides some authentication modifiers like auth, which might be related to roles or permissions.

First, I need to check all the functions and see if they have proper access controls. The functions with the 'auth' modifier are probably restricted, but maybe some functions that should be restricted aren't. Let's go through each function one by one.

Looking at the constructor, it initializes wards with msg.sender, which is standard. The 'file' function is external and has the auth modifier, so only authorized users can change gateway or poolManager. That seems okay.

Now, functions like requestDeposit and requestRedeem have the auth modifier. But wait, the auth here is applied to the function, which means only authorized addresses (wards) can call them. But in the context of this contract, maybe these functions are supposed to be called by specific other contracts, like the LiquidityPool. Let me check the code again.

Wait, the requestDeposit function is marked as public auth. The comment says that the LiquidityPools have to request investments. So if the auth is only allowing wards, but the intended caller is the LiquidityPool contract, then this might be an issue. Because if the auth is based on wards, then only the admin can call these functions, but the LiquidityPool should be the one calling them. That could be a problem. But maybe the auth here is set up so that the LiquidityPool is added as a ward. But if that's not the case, then the auth modifier would restrict it to only the admin, which is incorrect.

Wait, looking at the modifiers, there's a 'onlyGateway' modifier used in some functions. But the functions like requestDeposit and requestRedeem have the auth modifier, not onlyGateway. So if the auth is not properly set up to allow the LiquidityPool to call these functions, then they might be accessible only by the admin, which would be a problem. But the code uses 'auth' which is from the Auth contract. The Auth contract's 'auth' modifier checks if the sender is a ward (i.e., has been granted access via 'rely' function). So if the LiquidityPool contracts are not added as wards, then these functions can't be called by them. But the intended design might be that the LiquidityPool is allowed to call these functions. If that's the case, then the current setup with 'auth' would be incorrect because only the admin (wards) can call them, not the LiquidityPool. Therefore, this is an access control issue.

Wait, but the functions like requestDeposit and requestRedeem are called by the LiquidityPool. How does the auth work here? For example, in the requestDeposit function, the code says 'msg.sender' is the LiquidityPool. But if the auth modifier is used, then the msg.sender must be a ward. Unless the LiquidityPool has been added as a ward via the rely function. But if that's not done, then the auth check would fail. So the problem here is that the auth modifier is used where it should be a different check, like ensuring that the msg.sender is a valid LiquidityPool. Alternatively, maybe the auth is intended here, but that would mean that only the admin can trigger these functions, which is not correct. Therefore, using the auth modifier here is a mistake, leading to access control issues.

Another thing to check: the functions decreaseDepositRequest, decreaseRedeemRequest, collectDeposit, collectRedeem, processDeposit, processMint, processRedeem, processWithdraw all have the auth modifier. If these functions are supposed to be called by the LiquidityPool, then the same issue applies. The auth modifier restricts them to wards, but they should be callable by the pool.

For example, the processDeposit function is supposed to be called by the LiquidityPool (msg.sender is the liquidityPool), but the auth modifier requires the sender to be a ward. If the LiquidityPool is not a ward, then this function can't be called, which would be a problem. Therefore, the auth modifier here is incorrect, leading to access control issues.

So the main issue is that functions that should be callable by the LiquidityPool (msg.sender being the pool) are instead protected by the auth modifier, which checks for wards. Unless the pools are added as wards, which is unlikely, these functions would be inaccessible, but if the intention is that any pool can call them, then the auth modifier is wrong and should be replaced with a different check, perhaps ensuring that the msg.sender is a valid pool.

Alternatively, maybe the auth is intended here, but that would mean that only authorized addresses (like the admin) can call these functions, which would be a problem because the LiquidityPool needs to call them. Therefore, the use of auth here is incorrect, leading to access control vulnerabilities.

Another possible issue is in the updateTrancheTokenPrice function. It has the onlyGateway modifier, which checks that the caller is the gateway. That's correct if only the gateway should update prices. But other functions like handleExecutedCollectInvest also have onlyGateway, which is correct.

Looking at the modifiers again: the onlyGateway modifier is used correctly in functions that should be called by the gateway. The auth modifier is used in functions that are supposed to be called by the LiquidityPool. But if the auth is not properly set up, then those functions are not callable by the pools.

So the key issue here is that functions like requestDeposit, requestRedeem, etc., are using the auth modifier when they should be using a different access control mechanism, such as ensuring that the msg.sender is a valid LiquidityPool. The current setup would require the admin to have added each LiquidityPool as a ward, which may not be the case, leading to these functions being inaccessible to the pools, or if the auth is not properly managed, allowing unauthorized access.

Therefore, the vulnerable functions are those that have the auth modifier but should instead have a different access control check. For example:

- requestDeposit (line 95)
- requestRedeem (line 121)
- decreaseDepositRequest (line 141)
- decreaseRedeemRequest (line 153)
- collectDeposit (line 165)
- collectRedeem (line 173)
- processDeposit (line 333)
- processMint (line 360)
- processRedeem (line 400)
- processWithdraw (line 423)

Each of these functions is marked with 'auth', but if they are intended to be called by the LiquidityPool (msg.sender being the pool), then the auth modifier is incorrect. The correct approach would be to have a modifier that checks if the msg.sender is a valid LiquidityPool, perhaps by checking against the poolManager or another registry. Using 'auth' here restricts access to wards, which may not include the pools, leading to unauthorized access or denial of service.

For example, the requestDeposit function is supposed to be called by the LiquidityPool (as per the comment: "Liquidity pools have to request investments..."), but the auth modifier requires the sender to be a ward. If the pools are not added as wards, they can't call this function, which breaks the intended functionality. Therefore, this is an access control issue because the function is protected by the wrong modifier.
</think>

1. Function requestDeposit (line 95) has the access control issues. Reason: The function uses the 'auth' modifier which restricts access to wards, but it is intended to be called by LiquidityPool contracts. If pools are not added as wards, they cannot invoke this function, leading to improper access control.

2. Function requestRedeem (line 121) has the access control issues. Reason: Similar to requestDeposit, the 'auth' modifier incorrectly restricts access to wards instead of allowing valid LiquidityPool contracts to call the function.

3. Function decreaseDepositRequest (line 141) has the access control issues. Reason: The 'auth' modifier limits access to wards, but the function should be callable by the LiquidityPool (msg.sender), leading to potential unauthorized access or denial of service.

4. Function decreaseRedeemRequest (line 153) has the access control issues. Reason: Uses 'auth' modifier instead of validating the caller is a legitimate LiquidityPool, causing improper access restrictions.

5. Function collectDeposit (line 165) has the access control issues. Reason: The 'auth' modifier restricts access to wards, but the function is meant to be called by the LiquidityPool, leading to incorrect access control.

6. Function collectRedeem (line 173) has the access control issues. Reason: Similar to collectDeposit, the 'auth' modifier prevents legitimate LiquidityPool callers if not configured as wards.

7. Function processDeposit (line 333) has the access control issues. Reason: The 'auth' modifier restricts access to wards, but the function should be invoked by the LiquidityPool (msg.sender), causing improper authorization.

8. Function processMint (line 360) has the access control issues. Reason: Incorrect use of 'auth' modifier prevents LiquidityPools from calling this function unless they are wards, violating intended access control.

9. Function processRedeem (line 400) has the access control issues. Reason: The 'auth' modifier restricts access to wards instead of allowing the LiquidityPool to execute the function, leading to potential failures in redemption processing.

10. Function processWithdraw (line 423) has the access control issues. Reason: Uses 'auth' modifier which improperly limits access to wards, whereas the function should be callable by the LiquidityPool contract.
