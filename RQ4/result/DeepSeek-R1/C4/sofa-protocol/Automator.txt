Okay, let's start by looking at the Automator contract. The first thing I notice is that it's using OpenZeppelin's OwnableUpgradeable, so the owner has some privileged functions. Let's check all the functions to see if there are any that should have access control but don't.

Looking at the functions, the deposit and withdraw functions are public. Wait, withdraw is called by users to redeem their shares. But maybe there's an issue with access control elsewhere. Let's check the mintProducts and burnProducts functions. 

The mintProducts function has a loop where it calls IVault.mint for each product. It checks that the vault is enabled, but does it check if the caller is authorized? The function is external, so anyone can call it. But the parameters include a signature from the maker. The code recovers the signer and checks if they're a valid maker. So maybe only valid makers can initiate this via their signature. But wait, the function is called by anyone, but the signature is checked. So maybe that's okay. But let me double-check.

Wait, the mintProducts function requires that the signer of the aggregated signature is a valid maker. But the way the signatures are combined might be an issue. They XOR all the keccak hashes of the makerSignatures. That's a problem because XOR is commutative, so different orderings of the same signatures would produce the same combined hash. An attacker could potentially replay signatures or reorder them. But the main issue here is that the function doesn't check if the msg.sender is authorized. However, the function's logic relies on the signature being from a valid maker, so maybe that's sufficient. But maybe there's a way to bypass this if the signature is not properly validated. However, this might be more of a signature verification flaw rather than access control.

Looking at burnProducts, it's an external function. Let's see what it does. It calls IVault.burnBatch for each product. The products are provided by the caller. The function then updates positions and calculates fees. But does this function have any access control? It's public, so anyone can call it. But does it require that the caller is the owner or has some role? The function doesn't have any modifiers like onlyOwner. So an attacker could call burnProducts with arbitrary products, which would call burnBatch on the vaults. What's the impact of that? The burnBatch function in the vault might have its own access control, but if not, this could allow anyone to burn products, leading to loss of collateral. But the Automator's burnProducts function doesn't check if the caller is authorized. This is a problem because even if the vault's burnBatch has access control, the Automator's function should ensure that only allowed parties can trigger it. Since the Automator's burnProducts is external and has no access control, this is a vulnerability.

Another function to check is harvest. It transfers the accumulated fees to the feeCollector. The function is external and has no access control. But the feeCollector is set by the owner. However, anyone can trigger the transfer of fees to the feeCollector. This might not be a critical issue, but maybe the intention was that only the owner or feeCollector can call this. But according to the code, there's no modifier, so anyone can call harvest, which might be a problem if the fee collection should be restricted.

Looking at enableVaults and disableVaults, they have onlyOwner modifiers, which is correct. Same for enableMakers and disableMakers. The updateReferral is also onlyOwner. The initialize function is initializer, which is correct.

The withdraw function allows users to redeem their shares, but it checks their balance and pending redemptions. The claimRedemptions function also seems okay with the time lock.

So the main issues are:

1. burnProducts function (line 146-174) is external and has no access control. Anyone can call it, which could lead to unauthorized burning of products in the vaults. If the vault's burnBatch doesn't have proper access control, this could be exploited. Even if the vault does have access control, the Automator's function should restrict who can trigger it, perhaps only the owner or specific roles.

2. harvest function (line 176-183) is external and lacks access control. Anyone can trigger the transfer of fees to the feeCollector. While it doesn't steal funds (it sends to feeCollector), it might be intended to be called by the owner or automatically, so allowing anyone to trigger it could be an issue.

So these two functions are missing access control modifiers. The burnProducts and harvest functions should have some form of access control, like onlyOwner or a specific role.
</think>

1. Function burnProducts (lines 146-174) has access control issues. Reason: The burnProducts function is externally accessible without any access control modifiers, allowing any user to trigger the burning of products in connected vaults. This could lead to unauthorized manipulation of collateral and positions if the vault's burnBatch function lacks proper access controls.

2. Function harvest (lines 176-183) has access control issues. Reason: The harvest function lacks access control, enabling any user to force fee collection transfers. While funds move to the predefined feeCollector, this bypasses intended administrative control over the timing of fee collection processes.
