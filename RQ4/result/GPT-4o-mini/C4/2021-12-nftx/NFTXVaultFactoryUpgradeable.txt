1. Function assignFees() (line 30-38) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any user, and it modifies the factoryMintFee and other fee variables without any access control checks, potentially allowing unauthorized users to set fees.

2. Function setFactoryFees() (line 49-66) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any user, and it modifies the factory fees without any access control checks, allowing unauthorized users to change critical fee settings.

3. Function setVaultFees() (line 78-100) has access control issues. Reason: The function allows any user to set vault fees if they are not the owner, as long as they are the vault address. This could allow a malicious user to manipulate fees if they can deploy a vault.

4. Function disableVaultFees() (line 102-115) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to setVaultFees, this function allows any user to disable vault fees if they are the vault address, which could lead to unauthorized manipulation of fee settings.

5. Function setFeeDistributor() (line 117-123) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any user, and it modifies the feeDistributor address without any access control checks, allowing unauthorized users to change the fee distribution settings.

6. Function setZapContract() (line 125-131) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any user, and it modifies the zapContract address without any access control checks, allowing unauthorized users to change the zap contract settings.

7. Function setFeeExclusion() (line 133-139) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any user, and it modifies the excludedFromFees mapping without any access control checks, allowing unauthorized users to manipulate fee exclusions.

8. Function setEligibilityManager() (line 141-147) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any user, and it modifies the eligibilityManager address without any access control checks, allowing unauthorized users to change eligibility management settings.

In summary, the contract has multiple functions that lack proper access control checks, allowing unauthorized users to modify critical variables and settings.
