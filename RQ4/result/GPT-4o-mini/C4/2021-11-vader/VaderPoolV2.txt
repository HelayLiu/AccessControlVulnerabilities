1. Function initialize() (line 45-66) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by anyone since it is marked as `external` without any access control checks, which allows unauthorized users to initialize the contract and set critical state variables like `wrapper`, `synthFactory`, and `router`.

2. Function mintSynth() (line 68-102) has access control issues. Reason: The function is marked as `external` and does not have any access control checks, allowing any user to mint synthetic assets, which could lead to unauthorized minting and manipulation of the contract's state.

3. Function burnSynth() (line 104-134) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to `mintSynth`, this function is also marked as `external` and lacks access control checks, allowing any user to burn synthetic assets, which could lead to unauthorized asset destruction and manipulation of the contract's state.

4. Function burn() (line 136-164) has access control issues. Reason: The function is marked as `external` and is only restricted by the `onlyRouter` modifier, which may not be adequately enforced or verified, potentially allowing unauthorized users to call this function if the `onlyRouter` modifier is not properly implemented.

5. Function mintFungible() (line 166-205) has access control issues. Reason: This function is marked as `external` and does not have any access control checks, allowing any user to mint fungible tokens, which could lead to unauthorized minting and manipulation of the contract's state.

6. Function burnFungible() (line 207-239) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to `mintFungible`, this function is also marked as `external` and lacks access control checks, allowing any user to burn fungible tokens, which could lead to unauthorized asset destruction and manipulation of the contract's state.

7. Function toggleQueue() (line 241-248) has access control issues. Reason: Although this function is marked with `onlyOwner`, it is critical to ensure that the owner is properly set and verified, as any unauthorized change to the queue status could affect the contract's functionality.

8. Function setTokenSupport() (line 250-261) has access control issues. Reason: This function is also marked with `onlyOwner`, but it is essential to ensure that the owner is properly set and verified, as unauthorized changes to token support could lead to significant issues in the contract's operation.

9. Function setFungibleTokenSupport() (line 263-272) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to `setTokenSupport`, this function is marked with `onlyOwner`, and it is crucial to ensure that the owner is properly set and verified to prevent unauthorized creation of fungible token wrappers.

In summary, the following functions have access control issues:
- initialize() (line 45-66)
- mintSynth() (line 68-102)
- burnSynth() (line 104-134)
- burn() (line 136-164)
- mintFungible() (line 166-205)
- burnFungible() (line 207-239)
- toggleQueue() (line 241-248)
- setTokenSupport() (line 250-261)
- setFungibleTokenSupport() (line 263-272)
