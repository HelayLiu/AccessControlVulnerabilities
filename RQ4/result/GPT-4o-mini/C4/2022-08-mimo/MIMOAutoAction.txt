1. Function setAutomation(uint256 vaultId, AutomatedVault calldata autoParams) (line 36-62) has access control issues. Reason: The function allows any user to set automation parameters for a vault as long as they are either the vault owner or the current proxy of the vault owner. However, if the vault owner is not properly validated or if the proxy mechanism is compromised, unauthorized users could potentially modify the automation parameters of a vault they do not own. This could lead to unauthorized changes in the vault's behavior and management.
