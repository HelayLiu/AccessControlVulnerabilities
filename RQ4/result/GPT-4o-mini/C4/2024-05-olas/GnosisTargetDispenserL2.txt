1. Function receiveMessage(bytes memory data) (line 56-63) has access control issues. Reason: The function does not perform any access control checks to ensure that only authorized contracts or addresses can call it. This could allow any address to invoke this function and potentially manipulate the state of the contract by processing arbitrary messages.

2. Function onTokenBridged(address, uint256, bytes calldata data) (line 70-78) has access control issues. Reason: While this function checks that the caller is the `l2TokenRelayer`, it does not verify the legitimacy of the `data` being processed. If an attacker can somehow control the `data` being sent, they could exploit this function to manipulate the contract's state or perform unauthorized actions.
