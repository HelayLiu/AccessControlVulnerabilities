1. Function `onlyMinter()` (line 30-32) has access control issues. Reason: The `onlyMinter` modifier does not contain a `require` statement to enforce the access control check. As a result, any user can call functions that use this modifier, potentially allowing unauthorized minting of tickets.

2. Function `mint(address to_, uint256 id_, uint256 amount_, bytes memory data_)` (line 66-70) has access control issues. Reason: This function is intended to be callable only by the designated minter, but since the `onlyMinter` modifier lacks a proper access control check, any user can invoke this function and mint tickets, leading to unauthorized ticket creation.

3. Function `mintBatch(address to_, uint256[] memory ids_, uint256[] memory amounts_, bytes memory data_)` (line 75-79) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to the `mint` function, this function is also intended to be callable only by the designated minter. However, due to the lack of a proper access control check in the `onlyMinter` modifier, any user can call this function and mint tickets in bulk, leading to unauthorized ticket creation.
