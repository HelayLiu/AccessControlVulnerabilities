1. Function configureLockdrop (line 66-78) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any address since it is marked as `external` and does not have sufficient access control checks to ensure that only authorized users (e.g., admins) can configure the lockdrop settings.

2. Function configureToken (line 80-92) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to `configureLockdrop`, this function is also marked as `external` and lacks proper access control checks, allowing any address to configure tokens.

3. Function setUSDThresholds (line 94-106) has access control issues. Reason: This function is marked as `external` and can be called by any address, which means that anyone can change the approval and disapproval thresholds without proper authorization.

4. Function proposeUSDPrice (line 108-134) has access control issues. Reason: The function is marked as `external` and allows any address with the specified roles to propose a USD price. However, if the roles are not properly managed, unauthorized users could potentially propose prices.

5. Function approveUSDPrice (line 136-158) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any address with the specified roles to approve a USD price proposal. If the roles are not properly managed, unauthorized users could approve prices.

8. Function lockOnBehalf (line 208-224) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any address to lock tokens on behalf of another address, which could lead to unauthorized locking of tokens if the `_onBehalfOf` address is not properly validated.

9. Function lock (line 226-240) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to `lockOnBehalf`, this function allows any address to lock tokens without proper checks to ensure that the caller is authorized to perform this action.

10. Function unlock (line 242-261) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any address to unlock tokens, which could lead to unauthorized unlocking if the caller is not the actual owner of the locked tokens.

11. Function getLocked (line 263-284) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any address to retrieve the locked tokens of any player, which could lead to privacy issues if sensitive information is exposed.

12. Function getLockedWeightedValue (line 286-308) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to `getLocked`, this function allows any address to retrieve the locked weighted value of any player, which could lead to privacy issues.

13. Function getConfiguredToken (line 310-316) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any address to retrieve the configuration of any token, which could lead to privacy issues.

14. Function getPlayerSettings (line 318-324) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any address to retrieve the player settings of any player, which could lead to privacy issues.
