1. Function init(address _vader, address _usdv, address _router, address _factory) (line 30-35) has access control issues. Reason: The `init` function can be called by anyone to initialize the contract, which can lead to unauthorized changes to critical state variables such as `VADER`, `USDV`, `ROUTER`, and `FACTORY`. This function should be restricted to only the contract owner or a designated initializer.

2. Function addLiquidity(address base, address token, address member) (line 54-78) has access control issues. Reason: The `addLiquidity` function does not check if the caller is a valid member or has the right to add liquidity. This could allow unauthorized users to manipulate liquidity amounts and potentially exploit the contract.

3. Function removeLiquidity(address base, address token, uint basisPoints) (line 80-82) has access control issues. Reason: The `removeLiquidity` function calls `_removeLiquidity` with `tx.origin`, which can be exploited if the function is called from a malicious contract. This could allow unauthorized users to remove liquidity from the pool.

4. Function removeLiquidityDirectly(address base, address token, uint basisPoints) (line 84-86) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to the previous function, this function does not validate the caller's permissions, allowing anyone to remove liquidity directly.

5. Function swap(address base, address token, address member, bool toBase) (line 106-134) has access control issues. Reason: The `swap` function does not check if the caller is authorized to perform swaps, which could lead to unauthorized swaps and manipulation of token amounts.

6. Function deploySynth(address token) (line 144-147) has access control issues. Reason: The `deploySynth` function does not restrict who can deploy a synth, allowing any user to create a synth, which could lead to abuse and potential loss of funds.

7. Function mintSynth(address base, address token, address member) (line 150-162) has access control issues. Reason: The `mintSynth` function does not check if the caller is authorized to mint synths, which could allow unauthorized users to mint synths and manipulate the pool.

8. Function burnSynth(address base, address token, address member) (line 165-179) has access control issues. Reason: The `burnSynth` function does not validate if the caller is authorized to burn synths, which could lead to unauthorized burning of synths and loss of funds.

9. Function lockUnits(uint units, address token, address member) (line 182-185) has access control issues. Reason: The `lockUnits` function does not check if the caller is authorized to lock units, which could allow unauthorized users to manipulate unit allocations.

10. Function unlockUnits(uint units, address token, address member) (line 188-191) has access control issues. Reason: The `unlockUnits` function does not validate the caller's permissions, allowing unauthorized users to unlock units and manipulate allocations.

In summary, the contract has multiple functions that lack proper access control checks, allowing unauthorized users to manipulate critical state variables and perform sensitive operations.
