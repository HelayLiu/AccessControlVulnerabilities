1. Function `execute(uint256 tokenId, Instructions memory instructions)` (line 90-91) has access control issues. Reason: The function does not check if the caller is authorized to execute the instructions on the provided NFT. This could allow any user to manipulate the NFT without proper authorization.

2. Function `onERC721Received(address, address from, uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data)` (line 164-165) has access control issues. Reason: The function does not verify if the `from` address is authorized to send the NFT to this contract. This could allow unauthorized users to trigger the execution of instructions on the NFT.

3. Function `swap(SwapParams calldata params)` (line 236-237) has access control issues. Reason: The function does not restrict who can call it, allowing any user to initiate a swap, which could lead to unauthorized token transfers.

4. Function `swapAndMint(SwapAndMintParams calldata params)` (line 284-285) has access control issues. Reason: The function does not restrict who can call it, allowing any user to mint new tokens and potentially manipulate liquidity positions without authorization.

5. Function `swapAndIncreaseLiquidity(SwapAndIncreaseLiquidityParams calldata params)` (line 335-336) has access control issues. Reason: The function does not restrict who can call it, allowing any user to increase liquidity for any position, which could lead to unauthorized manipulation of liquidity.

These functions lack proper access control checks, which could lead to unauthorized actions being performed on the contract.
