1. Function initialize() (line 20-34) has access control issues. Reason: The `initialize()` function is public and can be called by anyone, which allows any address to initialize the contract and potentially set critical parameters such as `_lockCreator`, `_expirationDuration`, `_keyPrice`, etc. This can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract's state.

2. Function supportsInterface() (line 36-50) has access control issues. Reason: The `supportsInterface()` function is public and does not have any access control checks. Although it is meant to check for interface support, if there are any internal state changes or sensitive operations in the overridden functions from the mixins, it could lead to unintended consequences if called by unauthorized users.
