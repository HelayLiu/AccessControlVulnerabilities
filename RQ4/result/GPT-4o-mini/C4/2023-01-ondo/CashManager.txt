1. Function `setMintExchangeRate` (line 139-164) has access control issues. Reason: The function allows the `SETTER_ADMIN` role to set the mint exchange rate without sufficient checks on the validity of the new exchange rate, which could lead to manipulation of the minting process if the `SETTER_ADMIN` role is compromised.

2. Function `overrideExchangeRate` (line 174-198) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows the `MANAGER_ADMIN` to arbitrarily set an exchange rate for a given epoch without any checks on the validity of the new exchange rate, which could lead to significant financial loss if misused.

3. Function `setMintFee` (line 218-230) has access control issues. Reason: The function allows the `MANAGER_ADMIN` to set the mint fee without any checks on the maximum allowable fee, which could lead to excessive fees being charged if the `MANAGER_ADMIN` role is compromised.

4. Function `setMinimumDepositAmount` (line 240-254) has access control issues. Reason: The function allows the `MANAGER_ADMIN` to set the minimum deposit amount without any checks on the minimum allowable value, which could lead to users being unable to mint tokens if the value is set too high.

5. Function `setFeeRecipient` (line 264-272) has access control issues. Reason: The function allows the `MANAGER_ADMIN` to change the fee recipient address without any checks on the validity of the new address, which could lead to funds being sent to an unintended recipient.

6. Function `setAssetRecipient` (line 282-290) has access control issues. Reason: The function allows the `MANAGER_ADMIN` to change the asset recipient address without any checks on the validity of the new address, which could lead to funds being sent to an unintended recipient.

7. Function `setAssetSender` (line 370-378) has access control issues. Reason: The function allows the `MANAGER_ADMIN` to change the asset sender address without any checks on the validity of the new address, which could lead to funds being sent from an unintended source.

8. Function `setRedeemMinimum` (line 396-404) has access control issues. Reason: The function allows the `MANAGER_ADMIN` to set the minimum redeem amount without any checks on the minimum allowable value, which could lead to users being unable to redeem tokens if the value is set too high.

9. Function `completeRedemptions` (line 335-353) has access control issues. Reason: The function allows the `MANAGER_ADMIN` to distribute collateral based on the total amount of cash tokens burned without sufficient checks on the validity of the parameters, which could lead to incorrect distributions if misused.

10. Function `multiexcall` (line 487-503) has access control issues. Reason: The function allows the `MANAGER_ADMIN` to execute arbitrary calls to other contracts while the contract is paused, which could lead to unexpected behavior or exploitation if the `MANAGER_ADMIN` role is compromised.

These functions should have additional checks or restrictions to ensure that only authorized users can invoke them and that the parameters being set are valid and within acceptable limits.
