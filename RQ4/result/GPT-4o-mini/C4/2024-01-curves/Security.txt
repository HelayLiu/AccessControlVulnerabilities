1. Function onlyOwner() (line 7-9) has access control issues. Reason: The modifier onlyOwner does not contain a require statement to enforce the access control check, which means any user can bypass this check and execute functions that are supposed to be restricted to the owner.

2. Function onlyManager() (line 11-13) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to the onlyOwner modifier, the onlyManager modifier lacks a require statement, allowing any user to bypass the access control check and execute functions that should be restricted to managers.

3. Function transferOwnership(address owner_) (line 18-20) has access control issues. Reason: The transferOwnership function can be called by any address since the onlyOwner modifier does not enforce access control, allowing unauthorized users to change the owner of the contract.

4. Function setManager(address manager_, bool value) (line 15-17) has access control issues. Reason: The setManager function can be called by any address since the onlyOwner modifier does not enforce access control, allowing unauthorized users to add or remove managers.
