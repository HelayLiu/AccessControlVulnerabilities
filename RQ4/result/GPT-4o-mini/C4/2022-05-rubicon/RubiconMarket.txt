14. Function `del_rank(uint256 id)` (line 368-370) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any user to delete an offer from the rank without proper checks, which could lead to unauthorized deletions.

15. Function `setMinSell(ERC20 pay_gem, uint256 dust)` (line 374-377) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any user with the `auth` modifier to set the minimum sell amount, which could be exploited if the `auth` modifier is not properly restricted.

16. Function `setBuyEnabled(bool buyEnabled_)` (line 378-381) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any user with the `auth` modifier to enable or disable buying, which could lead to unauthorized changes in market behavior.

17. Function `setMatchingEnabled(bool matchingEnabled_)` (line 382-385) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any user with the `auth` modifier to enable or disable matching, which could lead to unauthorized changes in market behavior.

18. Function `getBestOffer(ERC20 sell_gem, ERC20 buy_gem)` (line 410-412) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any user to retrieve the best offer without proper checks, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive market data.

19. Function `getWorseOffer(uint256 id)` (line 414-416) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any user to retrieve the worse offer without proper checks, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive market data.

21. Function `getOfferCount(ERC20 sell_gem, ERC20 buy_gem)` (line 422-424) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any user to retrieve the offer count without proper checks, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive market data.

22. Function `getFirstUnsortedOffer()` (line 426-428) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any user to retrieve the first unsorted offer without proper checks, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive market data.

23. Function `getNextUnsortedOffer(uint256 id)` (line 430-432) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any user to retrieve the next unsorted offer without proper checks, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive market data.

24. Function `sellAllAmount(ERC20 pay_gem, uint256 pay_amt, ERC20 buy_gem, uint256 min_fill_amount)` (line 434-438) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any user to sell all amounts without proper checks, which could lead to unauthorized trades being executed.

25. Function `buyAllAmount(ERC20 buy_gem, uint256 buy_amt, ERC20 pay_gem, uint256 max_fill_amount)` (line 440-444) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any user to buy all amounts without proper checks, which could lead to unauthorized trades being executed.
