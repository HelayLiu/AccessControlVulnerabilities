1. Function `pausePool()` (line 102-104) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any user since it lacks a proper access control modifier, allowing anyone to pause the pool, which could lead to denial of service for legitimate users.

2. Function `setOptimalIdleRange(OptimalIdleRange memory _optimalIdleRange)` (line 107-111) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by any user since it lacks a proper access control modifier, allowing unauthorized users to change the optimal idle range.

3. Function `setBaseInterestAllocator(address _newBaseInterestAllocator)` (line 114-119) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by any user since it lacks a proper access control modifier, allowing unauthorized users to set a new base interest allocator.

4. Function `setReallocationBonus(uint256 _newReallocationBonus)` (line 126-130) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by any user since it lacks a proper access control modifier, allowing unauthorized users to change the reallocation bonus.

5. Function `confirmBaseInterestAllocator(address _newBaseInterestAllocator)` (line 134-157) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by any user since it lacks a proper access control modifier, allowing unauthorized users to confirm a new base interest allocator.

6. Function `queueClaimAll()` (line 197-199) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by any user since it lacks a proper access control modifier, allowing unauthorized users to claim all pending withdrawals.

7. Function `deployWithdrawalQueue()` (line 202-204) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by any user since it lacks a proper access control modifier, allowing unauthorized users to deploy a new withdrawal queue.

8. Function `reallocate()` (line 305-310) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by any user since it lacks a proper access control modifier, allowing unauthorized users to reallocate funds.

9. Function `loanRepayment(...)` (line 319-327) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by any user since it lacks a proper access control modifier, allowing unauthorized users to process loan repayments.

10. Function `loanLiquidation(...)` (line 331-339) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by any user since it lacks a proper access control modifier, allowing unauthorized users to process loan liquidations.

In summary, multiple functions in the contract lack proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized users to perform sensitive operations that could compromise the integrity and security of the contract.
