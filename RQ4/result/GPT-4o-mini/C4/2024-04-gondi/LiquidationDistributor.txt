1. Function distribute() (line 30-81) has access control issues. Reason: The `distribute` function is marked as `external`, allowing any user to call it. This means that any address can invoke this function and potentially manipulate the liquidation process without any checks on whether they are authorized to do so. There are no access control checks to ensure that only a legitimate liquidator can call this function, which could lead to unauthorized access and exploitation of the contract.
