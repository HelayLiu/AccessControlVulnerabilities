1. Function `addReferral(address account, address referral)` (line 139-145) has access control issues. Reason: The function allows any user to add a referral for any account as long as they are the `depositHandler`. If the `depositHandler` is compromised or malicious, it can manipulate referrals for any account, leading to potential exploitation.

2. Function `burnGToken(bool pwrd, bool all, address account, uint256 amount, uint256 bonus)` (line 205-213) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any address that is set as `withdrawHandler` or `emergencyHandler`. If these addresses are compromised, an attacker could burn tokens for any account, leading to loss of assets.

3. Function `mintGToken(bool pwrd, address account, uint256 amount)` (line 218-225) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to `burnGToken`, this function can be called by any address that is set as `depositHandler`. If this address is compromised, it can mint tokens for any account, leading to inflation of the token supply and potential financial loss for users.

4. Function `emergency(uint256 coin)` (line 295-308) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any whitelisted address, which could potentially include malicious actors if the whitelist is not properly managed. This could lead to the disabling of a stablecoin without proper oversight.

5. Function `restart(uint256[] calldata allocations)` (line 313-325) has access control issues. Reason: This function can only be called by the owner when the contract is paused. If the owner is compromised, they can manipulate the allocations without any checks from other stakeholders.

6. Function `realizePriceChange(uint256 tolerance)` (line 284-293) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by the owner, and if the owner is compromised, they can manipulate the price changes without any checks from other stakeholders.

In summary, the identified functions have potential access control issues due to insufficient restrictions on who can call them, which could lead to unauthorized actions and exploitation of the contract.
