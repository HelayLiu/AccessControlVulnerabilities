1. Function rotateSigners(address[] memory newAccounts, uint256 newThreshold) (line 106-108) has access control issues. Reason: The rotateSigners function is protected by the onlySigners modifier, which allows any signer to call it. However, if a malicious signer is part of the signers array, they can manipulate the signers and threshold, potentially locking out other legitimate signers or changing the threshold to a value that benefits them. This could lead to a situation where the multisig wallet is compromised.
