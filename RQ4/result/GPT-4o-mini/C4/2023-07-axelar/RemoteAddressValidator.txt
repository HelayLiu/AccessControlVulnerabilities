1. Function addTrustedAddress(string memory chain, string memory addr) (line 66-73) has access control issues. Reason: The function is marked as `public` and can be called by anyone, allowing unauthorized users to add trusted addresses, which could lead to malicious actors being able to manipulate the contract's trusted address list.

2. Function removeTrustedAddress(string calldata chain) (line 75-82) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to `addTrustedAddress`, this function is also marked as `external` and can be called by anyone, allowing unauthorized users to remove trusted addresses, which could disrupt the contract's functionality.

3. Function addGatewaySupportedChains(string[] calldata chainNames) (line 84-92) has access control issues. Reason: This function is marked as `external` and can be called by anyone, allowing unauthorized users to add chains to the supported list, which could lead to manipulation of the contract's supported chains.

4. Function removeGatewaySupportedChains(string[] calldata chainNames) (line 94-102) has access control issues. Reason: This function is also marked as `external` and can be called by anyone, allowing unauthorized users to remove chains from the supported list, which could disrupt the contract's functionality.

In summary, the functions `addTrustedAddress`, `removeTrustedAddress`, `addGatewaySupportedChains`, and `removeGatewaySupportedChains` lack proper access control checks, allowing unauthorized users to manipulate critical mappings in the contract.
