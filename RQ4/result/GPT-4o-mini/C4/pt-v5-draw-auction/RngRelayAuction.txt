1. Function `rngComplete` (line 83-130) has access control issues. Reason: The `rngComplete` function is called by the relayer to complete the RNG relay auction, but there are no access control checks to ensure that only the designated `rngAuctionRelayer` can call this function. This could allow any address to complete the auction, potentially leading to unauthorized access and manipulation of auction results.
