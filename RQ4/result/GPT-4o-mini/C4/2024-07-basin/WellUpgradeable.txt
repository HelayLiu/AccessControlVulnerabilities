1. Function `init(string memory _name, string memory _symbol)` (line 22-38) has access control issues. Reason: The `init` function is marked as `external` and can be called by anyone, allowing unauthorized users to initialize the contract and potentially set critical state variables.

2. Function `initNoWellToken()` (line 40-42) has access control issues. Reason: The `initNoWellToken` function is marked as `external` and can be called by anyone, which could lead to unintended initialization of the contract without proper checks.

3. Function `upgradeTo(address newImplementation)` (line 66-70) has access control issues. Reason: The `upgradeTo` function is marked as `public`, allowing anyone to call it and potentially upgrade the contract to a malicious implementation if they can manipulate the `_authorizeUpgrade` checks.

4. Function `upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes memory data)` (line 73-77) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to `upgradeTo`, this function is also marked as `public`, allowing unauthorized users to upgrade the contract and execute arbitrary code if they can bypass the `_authorizeUpgrade` checks.

5. Function `_authorizeUpgrade(address newImplmentation)` (line 54-64) has access control issues. Reason: While this function is marked as `internal`, it is crucial to ensure that the checks within it are robust enough to prevent unauthorized upgrades. If the checks are not properly validated, it could lead to unauthorized contract upgrades.

In summary, the main access control issues arise from the `init`, `initNoWellToken`, `upgradeTo`, and `upgradeToAndCall` functions being publicly accessible without sufficient restrictions, allowing unauthorized users to manipulate the contract's state and upgrade its implementation.
