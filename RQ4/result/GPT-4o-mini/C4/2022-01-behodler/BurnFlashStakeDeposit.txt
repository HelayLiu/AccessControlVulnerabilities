1. Function parameterize() (line 16-30) has access control issues. Reason: The parameterize() function is public and can be called by anyone, allowing any user to set the parameters for the contract, including the user, asset, amount, flashGoverner, and targetContract. This could lead to unauthorized users manipulating the contract's state and potentially executing the execute() function with malicious intent.

2. Function execute() (line 32-40) has access control issues. Reason: The execute() function is internal and can be called by any derived contract or within the same contract, but there are no checks to ensure that only authorized users can trigger this function. If the parameters are set by an unauthorized user, they could execute the function and perform actions on behalf of another user without their consent.
