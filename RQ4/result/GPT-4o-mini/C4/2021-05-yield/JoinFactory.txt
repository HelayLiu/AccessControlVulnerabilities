1. Function createJoin(address asset) (line 45-55) has access control issues. Reason: The function allows any user to deploy a new Join contract and grant themselves the ROOT role in that contract without any access control checks. This means that any user can create a Join instance and gain control over it, potentially leading to unauthorized access and manipulation of the Join contract.
