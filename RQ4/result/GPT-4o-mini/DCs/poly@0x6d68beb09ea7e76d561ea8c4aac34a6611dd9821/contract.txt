1. Function setOracleAddress(address oracle) (line 156-158) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any account, allowing anyone to set the oracle address, which could lead to manipulation of price data.

2. Function setLeveragePoolInfo(address payable _feeAddress,address leveragePool,address hedgePool, address oracle,address _swapRouter,address swaplib,address rebaseTokenA,address rebaseTokenB, uint256 fees,uint256 _threshold,uint256 rebaseWorth) (line 132-134) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by the owner only, but if the owner is compromised, it could lead to unauthorized changes to the leverage pool configuration.

3. Function setLeverageFee(uint256 _buyFee,uint256 _sellFee,uint256 _rebalanceFee) (line 118-120) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by the owner or origin, which could allow unauthorized users to set fees if they can impersonate the origin.

4. Function setSwapRoutingPath(address token0,address token1,address[] calldata swapPath) (line 104-106) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by any origin, which could allow unauthorized users to set swap paths.

5. Function setManager(address newManager) (line 66-68) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by the owner, but if the owner is compromised, it could lead to unauthorized changes to the manager.

6. Function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) (line 40-42) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by any account, allowing anyone to transfer ownership of the contract, which could lead to unauthorized control over the contract.

7. Function transferOrigin(address _newOrigin) (line 50-52) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by any account, allowing anyone to change the origin address, which could lead to unauthorized control over the contract.

8. Function setOperator(uint256 index,address newAddress) (line 80-82) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by the owner or origin, which could allow unauthorized users to set operators if they can impersonate the origin.

9. Function setSwapRouterAddress(address _swapRouter) (line 90-92) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by the owner or origin, which could allow unauthorized users to set the swap router address if they can impersonate the origin.

10. Function setFeeAddress(address payable addrFee) (line 138-140) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by the owner, but if the owner is compromised, it could lead to unauthorized changes to the fee address.

These functions lack proper access control mechanisms, which could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of critical contract parameters.
