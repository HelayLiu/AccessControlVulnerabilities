1. Function execute(ForwardRequest calldata req, bytes calldata signature) (line 83-100) has access control issues. Reason: The execute function allows any user to call it and execute arbitrary code on the `req.to` address with the provided `req.data`. This could lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the `req.from` address if the signature verification fails or is manipulated, allowing an attacker to potentially exploit the contract.
