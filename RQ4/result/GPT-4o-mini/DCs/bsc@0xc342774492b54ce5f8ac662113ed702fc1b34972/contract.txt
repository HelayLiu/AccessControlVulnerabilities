1. Function mint() (line 139-144) has access control issues. Reason: The mint function can be called by any user, allowing them to mint tokens without proper authorization, as it does not check if the caller is the owner or a designated signer before minting tokens.

2. Function revokeSigner() (line 155-157) has access control issues. Reason: The revokeSigner function can only be called by the owner, but if the owner is compromised, they can revoke signers without any checks or balances, potentially leading to a situation where valid signers are removed.

3. Function addSigner() (line 162-164) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to revokeSigner, the addSigner function can only be called by the owner, which poses a risk if the owner's account is compromised, allowing an attacker to add malicious signers. 

These functions lack sufficient access control checks to ensure that only authorized users can perform sensitive actions, which could lead to unauthorized minting of tokens or manipulation of signers.
