1. Function `setRouterAndFactory(address _router)` (line 174-178) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any address to set the router and factory addresses, which could lead to unauthorized changes to critical contract parameters.

2. Function `setSwapPlus(address _swapPlus)` (line 180-184) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to the previous function, this function allows any address to set the swapPlus address, which could be exploited to redirect funds or manipulate swaps.

3. Function `setRewarder(address _rewarder)` (line 186-190) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any address to set the rewarder address, which could lead to unauthorized access to reward distribution.

4. Function `setOperator(address _operator, bool mode)` (line 192-196) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any address to set operators, which could lead to unauthorized users gaining operator privileges.

5. Function `setOperatorSetter(address _operatorSetter)` (line 198-202) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows any address to change the operatorSetter, which could lead to unauthorized changes in operator management.

6. Function `withdraw(address account, address token0, address token1, uint256 amount, address tokenOut, uint256 basketId, address tokenM, swapPath calldata wpath, uint256[3] memory amountMin)` (line 118-119) has access control issues. Reason: The function allows the caller to withdraw funds from any account if they are an operator, which could lead to unauthorized withdrawals if an operator is compromised.

7. Function `deposit(address account, address token, address tokenM, swapPath calldata path, address token0, address token1, uint256[3] calldata amount, uint256 basketId)` (line 66-67) has access control issues. Reason: The function allows deposits from any account without proper checks, which could lead to unauthorized deposits or manipulation of balances.

These functions lack proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized users to manipulate critical aspects of the contract.
