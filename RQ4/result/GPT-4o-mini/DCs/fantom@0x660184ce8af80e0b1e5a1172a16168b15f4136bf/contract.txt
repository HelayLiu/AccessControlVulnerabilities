1. Function `proposeStrat(address _implementation)` (line 139-145) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by anyone, but it should only be callable by the owner to ensure that only the owner can propose a new strategy.

2. Function `upgradeStrat()` (line 153-164) has access control issues. Reason: Similar to `proposeStrat`, this function can also be called by anyone, but it should only be callable by the owner to ensure that only the owner can upgrade the strategy.

3. Function `inCaseTokensGetStuck(address _token)` (line 166-172) has access control issues. Reason: This function allows the owner to rescue tokens, but it can be exploited if the ownership is transferred to a malicious address, allowing that address to withdraw tokens from the contract.

4. Function `depositFor(address token, uint _amount, address user)` (line 174-189) has access control issues. Reason: This function can be called by anyone, allowing any user to deposit tokens on behalf of another user without any restrictions, which can lead to unauthorized deposits. 

These functions lack proper access control checks, which can lead to unauthorized actions being performed on the contract.
