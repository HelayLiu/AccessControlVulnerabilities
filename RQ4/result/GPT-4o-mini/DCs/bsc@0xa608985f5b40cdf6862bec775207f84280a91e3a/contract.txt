1. Function mint(address account, uint256 amount) (line 83-90) has access control issues. Reason: The mint function is public and can be called by anyone, allowing any address to mint new tokens, which can lead to inflation and devaluation of the token.

2. Function setProxySync(address _addr) (line 157-162) has access control issues. Reason: The setProxySync function can be called by any address, allowing any user to set the proxy address, which can lead to unauthorized access to the contract's functions.

3. Function reserveMultiSync(address syncAddr, uint256 syncAmount) (line 232-237) has access control issues. Reason: The reserveMultiSync function can be called by any address, allowing any user to manipulate the balances of other addresses, which can lead to unauthorized token transfers.

4. Function proxyReserves(address token, address addr, uint256 amount) (line 215-220) has access control issues. Reason: The proxyReserves function can be called by any address, allowing any user to transfer tokens from the contract to any address, which can lead to unauthorized withdrawals.

5. Function setSwapPairList(address addr, bool enable) (line 270-275) has access control issues. Reason: The setSwapPairList function can be called by any address, allowing any user to modify the swap pair list, which can lead to manipulation of trading pairs and potential exploits.

6. Function setFundAddress(address addr) (line 278-283) has access control issues. Reason: The setFundAddress function can be called by any address, allowing any user to change the fund address, which can lead to unauthorized access to funds.

7. Function setKillBatchBot(bool enable) (line 314-318) has access control issues. Reason: The setKillBatchBot function can be called by any address, allowing any user to enable or disable the bot-killing mechanism, which can lead to exploitation by malicious actors.

8. Function claimToken(address token, uint256 amount, address to) (line 335-338) has access control issues. Reason: The claimToken function can be called by any address, allowing any user to withdraw tokens from the contract, which can lead to unauthorized withdrawals.

These functions lack proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized users to perform sensitive actions that can compromise the integrity and security of the contract.
