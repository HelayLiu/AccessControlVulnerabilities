1. Function `setToken(address _addr)` (line 139-141) has access control issues. Reason: The `setToken` function is public and allows anyone to change the `stakingToken` and `rewardsToken` in the `configuration` variable. This can lead to unauthorized token changes, which can disrupt the contract's functionality and potentially allow malicious actors to exploit the contract by setting tokens that they control. 

To mitigate this issue, the function should be restricted to only allow the contract owner or an authorized role to call it.
