1. Function EAI_TokenERC20 (line 20-30) has access control issues. Reason: The constructor function EAI_TokenERC20 initializes the totalSupply and assigns all initial tokens to the contract creator (msg.sender) without any access control checks. This means that anyone can deploy the contract and set the initial supply, which could lead to unauthorized token creation.

2. Function burnFrom (line 88-98) has access control issues. Reason: The burnFrom function allows any user to burn tokens from another user's account as long as they have the allowance set. This could lead to a situation where a malicious user can burn tokens from another user's balance without their consent, as long as they have been granted an allowance. There are no checks to ensure that the caller has the right to perform this action beyond the allowance check.
