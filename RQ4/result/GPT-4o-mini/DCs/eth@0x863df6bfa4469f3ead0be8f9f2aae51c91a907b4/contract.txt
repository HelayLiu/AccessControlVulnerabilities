1. Function `initMultiowned(address[] _owners, uint _required)` (line 66-78) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by anyone to initialize the multi-owned structure, which could allow unauthorized users to set owners and the required number of confirmations.

2. Function `changeOwner(address _from, address _to)` (line 100-112) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any user, and if the `_from` address is an owner, it allows changing ownership without proper checks on the caller's permissions.

3. Function `addOwner(address _owner)` (line 114-126) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any user, allowing them to add themselves or any address as an owner without proper authorization.

4. Function `removeOwner(address _owner)` (line 128-141) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any user, allowing them to remove any owner without proper authorization.

5. Function `changeRequirement(uint _newRequired)` (line 143-155) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any user, allowing them to change the number of required confirmations without proper authorization.

6. Function `setDailyLimit(uint _newLimit)` (line 174-177) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any user, allowing them to set the daily limit without proper authorization.

7. Function `resetSpentToday()` (line 179-182) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any user, allowing them to reset the spent amount without proper authorization.

8. Function `kill(address _to)` (line 184-187) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any user, allowing them to destroy the contract and send funds to any address without proper authorization.

9. Function `execute(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data)` (line 189-217) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any user, allowing them to execute transactions without proper authorization checks.

10. Function `confirm(bytes32 _h)` (line 219-239) has access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any user, allowing them to confirm transactions without proper authorization checks.

These functions lack proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized users to perform sensitive operations that could compromise the integrity and security of the contract.
