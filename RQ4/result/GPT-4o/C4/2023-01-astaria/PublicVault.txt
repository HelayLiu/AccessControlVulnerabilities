Upon reviewing the provided `PublicVault` contract, I have identified potential access control issues. Here are the details:

1. **Function `processEpoch()` (line 312-365)**
   - **Reason**: The `processEpoch()` function is publicly accessible and can be called by any address. This function processes the current epoch, resets certain state variables, and interacts with the `WithdrawProxy`. Without proper access control, any user can trigger epoch processing, which might not be intended behavior and could lead to unexpected state changes or financial implications.

2. **Function `transferWithdrawReserve()` (line 421-464)**
   - **Reason**: This function is also publicly accessible and can be called by any address. It transfers the withdraw reserve to the `WithdrawProxy` and updates the state accordingly. Allowing any user to call this function could lead to unauthorized reserve transfers, potentially affecting the contract's financial state.

3. **Function `increaseYIntercept(uint256 amount)` (line 648-655)**
   - **Reason**: Although this function checks if the caller is the `withdrawProxy` of the previous epoch, it is publicly accessible. If the `withdrawProxy` address is compromised or incorrectly set, an unauthorized increase in the `yIntercept` could occur, affecting the vault's financial calculations.

4. **Function `decreaseYIntercept(uint256 amount)` (line 661-668)**
   - **Reason**: Similar to `increaseYIntercept`, this function is publicly accessible and relies on the caller being the `withdrawProxy` of the previous epoch. If the `withdrawProxy` address is compromised, it could lead to unauthorized decreases in the `yIntercept`, impacting the vault's financial state.

**Proof of Concept for `processEpoch()`:**

To demonstrate the potential issue with `processEpoch()`, consider the following scenario:

- Any user can call `processEpoch()` at any time, potentially disrupting the intended epoch processing schedule. This could lead to premature or repeated processing of epochs, affecting the distribution of assets and shares.

```solidity
// Malicious user calls processEpoch() to disrupt the epoch schedule
PublicVault vault = PublicVault(vaultAddress);
vault.processEpoch();
```

**Recommendation:**

To mitigate these issues, it is recommended to implement access control mechanisms, such as `onlyOwner` or `onlyAuthorized` modifiers, to restrict access to these functions. This ensures that only authorized entities can trigger critical state changes or financial operations within the contract.
