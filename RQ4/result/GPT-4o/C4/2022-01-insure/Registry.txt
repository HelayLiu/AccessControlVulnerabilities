OutPut:
1. Function `supportMarket(address _market)` (line 45-55) has an access control issue. Reason: The function allows either the `factory` or the `ownership.owner()` to register a new market. However, if the `factory` address is compromised or incorrectly set, unauthorized markets could be registered. It is crucial to ensure that the `factory` address is securely managed and only set by the contract owner.

2. Function `setExistence(address _template, address _target)` (line 61-68) has an access control issue. Reason: Similar to `supportMarket`, this function allows either the `factory` or the `ownership.owner()` to set existence. If the `factory` address is compromised, it could lead to unauthorized existence entries. Proper management and restriction of the `factory` address are necessary to prevent unauthorized access.

In both cases, the reliance on the `factory` address for access control without additional verification or restrictions poses a potential risk if the `factory` address is not securely managed.
