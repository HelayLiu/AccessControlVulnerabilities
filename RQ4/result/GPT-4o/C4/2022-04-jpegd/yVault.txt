Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, I have identified the following potential access control issues:

1. **Function `earn()` (line 128-132)**
   - **Reason**: The `earn()` function is publicly accessible and allows any user to transfer the available balance of the token to the controller and call the `earn` function on the controller. This could potentially be exploited by a malicious user to manipulate the strategy or cause unintended behavior if the controller is not properly secured or if the function is called at inappropriate times.

2. **Function `withdrawJPEG()` (line 184-187)**
   - **Reason**: The `withdrawJPEG()` function is publicly accessible and allows any user to trigger the withdrawal of JPEG tokens to the `farm` address. If the `farm` address is not set or is set to an unintended address, this could lead to loss of funds or tokens being sent to an incorrect address. Additionally, without proper access control, this function could be abused to frequently call the `withdrawJPEG` function on the controller, potentially disrupting its operations.

**Proof of Concept for `earn()` Function:**

To demonstrate the potential issue with the `earn()` function, consider the following scenario:

1. A user calls the `earn()` function repeatedly, transferring the available balance to the controller each time.
2. If the controller's `earn` function is not designed to handle such frequent calls, it could lead to unexpected behavior or inefficiencies in the strategy.

**Proof of Concept for `withdrawJPEG()` Function:**

To demonstrate the potential issue with the `withdrawJPEG()` function, consider the following scenario:

1. A user calls the `withdrawJPEG()` function when the `farm` address is not set, resulting in a failed transaction.
2. Alternatively, if the `farm` address is set to an incorrect address, the JPEG tokens could be sent to an unintended recipient.

**Recommendations:**

- Implement access control mechanisms for the `earn()` and `withdrawJPEG()` functions to restrict their usage to authorized entities or under specific conditions.
- Ensure that the `farm` address is properly set and validated before allowing withdrawals in the `withdrawJPEG()` function.
