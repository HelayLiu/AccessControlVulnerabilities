Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, I have identified a potential access control issue. Here is the analysis:

1. **Function `distribute()` (line 21-58)** has an access control issue. 
   - **Reason**: The `distribute` function is marked as `external` and does not have any access control modifiers or checks to restrict who can call it. This function is responsible for distributing proceeds from a liquidation based on tranches, which involves transferring tokens. Without proper access control, any external entity can invoke this function, potentially leading to unauthorized distribution of funds. This could be exploited by malicious actors to manipulate the distribution process or drain funds.

**Proof of Concept**:
- An attacker could call the `distribute` function with arbitrary `_proceeds` and `_loan` parameters, potentially causing incorrect distribution of funds or even transferring funds to unintended recipients.

To mitigate this issue, consider implementing access control mechanisms such as modifiers to restrict the function to be callable only by authorized entities, such as a specific contract or address.
