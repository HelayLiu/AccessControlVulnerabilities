Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, I have identified a potential access control issue:

1. **Function `onlyMinter` Modifier (line 54-56)**:
   - **Reason**: The `onlyMinter` modifier is intended to restrict access to certain functions to only the `minterAddress`. However, the modifier does not contain a `require` statement to enforce this restriction. The line `msg.sender == minterAddress;` is a comparison and does not have any effect on the execution flow. As a result, any address can call functions protected by this modifier, which could lead to unauthorized minting of tokens.

   **Proof of Concept**:
   - Deploy the contract and initialize it with a specific `minterAddress`.
   - Attempt to call the `mint` function from an address different from the `minterAddress`.
   - Observe that the function executes successfully, demonstrating that the access control is not enforced.

To fix this issue, the `onlyMinter` modifier should be updated to include a `require` statement, such as:

```solidity
modifier onlyMinter() {
    require(msg.sender == minterAddress, "Caller is not the minter");
    _;
}
```

This change will ensure that only the designated `minterAddress` can call functions protected by the `onlyMinter` modifier.
