Upon reviewing the provided `MultisigBase` contract, I have identified potential access control issues. Here is the analysis:

1. **Function `_rotateSigners()` (line 128-162)**:
   - **Reason**: This internal function is responsible for updating the list of signers and the threshold. Although it is called by the `rotateSigners` function, which is protected by the `onlySigners` modifier, the `_rotateSigners` function itself does not have any access control checks. If there were any other internal or external functions that could call `_rotateSigners` without proper access control, it could lead to unauthorized changes to the signers and threshold. However, in the current contract, `_rotateSigners` is only called by `rotateSigners`, which is correctly protected. Therefore, there is no immediate access control issue, but it is crucial to ensure that no other functions can call `_rotateSigners` without proper checks.

2. **Function `rotateSigners()` (line 118-126)**:
   - **Reason**: This function is protected by the `onlySigners` modifier, which ensures that only current signers can call it. The function allows the rotation of signers and updating the threshold, which is a critical operation. The access control seems appropriate as it requires a threshold of signers to approve the operation before it can be executed. There is no access control issue here as long as the `onlySigners` modifier is correctly implemented and the signers list is managed securely.

In conclusion, the contract appears to have appropriate access control mechanisms in place for the critical functions. The `onlySigners` modifier ensures that only authorized signers can execute sensitive operations. However, it is essential to maintain the integrity of the signers list and ensure that no unauthorized functions can call `_rotateSigners` directly. As of the current implementation, there are no access control vulnerabilities.
