Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, I have identified the following access control issues:

1. **Function `addTrustedAddress` (line 78-88)**:
   - **Reason**: This function is correctly protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, which ensures that only the contract owner can add a trusted interchain token service address. There is no access control issue here.

2. **Function `removeTrustedAddress` (line 90-96)**:
   - **Reason**: This function is also protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring that only the contract owner can remove a trusted interchain token service address. There is no access control issue here.

3. **Function `addGatewaySupportedChains` (line 98-106)**:
   - **Reason**: This function is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring that only the contract owner can add chains supported by the Axelar gateway. There is no access control issue here.

4. **Function `removeGatewaySupportedChains` (line 108-116)**:
   - **Reason**: This function is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring that only the contract owner can remove chains supported by the Axelar gateway. There is no access control issue here.

5. **Function `validateSender` (line 66-74)**:
   - **Reason**: This function is a public view function that checks if a sender is a valid interchain token service address. It does not modify any state and does not require access control. There is no access control issue here.

6. **Function `getRemoteAddress` (line 118-124)**:
   - **Reason**: This function is a public view function that retrieves the interchain token service address for a specified chain. It does not modify any state and does not require access control. There is no access control issue here.

Overall, the contract appears to have appropriate access control measures in place for functions that modify state, using the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access to the contract owner. There are no access control issues in the provided contract.
