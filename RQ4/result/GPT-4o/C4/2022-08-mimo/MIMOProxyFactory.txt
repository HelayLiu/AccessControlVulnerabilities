OutPut:
1. Function `deployFor(address owner)` (line 39-52) has the access control issues. Reason: The `deployFor` function is public and allows any user to deploy a proxy for any specified owner without any access control checks. This could lead to unauthorized users deploying proxies on behalf of others, potentially leading to misuse or unexpected behavior. A potential solution is to restrict this function to only allow certain authorized addresses to call it, or to ensure that the caller is the intended owner.
