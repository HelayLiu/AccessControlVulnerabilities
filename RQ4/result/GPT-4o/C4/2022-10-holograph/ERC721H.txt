1. Function `init(bytes memory initPayload)` (line 88-90) has the access control issues. Reason: The `init` function is marked as `external` and can be called by any address. This function is responsible for initializing the contract, which includes setting the holographer address. Without proper access control, any address can call this function and potentially reinitialize the contract, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

2. Function `_setOwner(address ownerAddress)` (line 155-157) has the access control issues. Reason: The `_setOwner` function is an internal function that directly modifies the owner of the contract. Although it is internal, if it is called from any function that lacks proper access control, it could lead to unauthorized changes of ownership. The contract does not provide a public or external function to change the owner, but if any future function calls `_setOwner` without proper access control, it could be exploited.
