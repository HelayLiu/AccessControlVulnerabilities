Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, I have identified the following potential access control issues:

1. **Function `approve` (line 122-124):**
   - **Reason:** The function `_requireAuthorised` is called with `msg.sender` and `_tokenId` to check if the sender is authorized to approve the token. However, the function allows the `msg.sender` to approve any address for a given `_tokenId` without checking if `msg.sender` is the owner of the token. This could potentially allow unauthorized users to approve others for token transfers if they are incorrectly marked as authorized.

2. **Function `setApprovalForAll` (line 127-129):**
   - **Reason:** This function allows any caller to set approval for all tokens they own to any operator. While this is standard behavior for ERC721 tokens, it is important to ensure that the caller is aware of the implications of granting such permissions. There is no explicit access control issue here, but it is crucial to ensure that users understand the risks of using this function.

3. **Function `_onTransferReceived` (line 58-75):**
   - **Reason:** This internal function checks if the recipient is a contract and then calls `onERC721Received`. However, it does not perform any access control checks on the caller or the recipient. This could potentially lead to issues if the recipient contract does not handle the callback correctly, although this is more of a security concern related to the recipient contract rather than an access control issue in this contract.

Overall, the contract seems to follow the standard ERC721 pattern for access control, but it is important to ensure that the `_requireAuthorised` function is correctly implemented to prevent unauthorized approvals. Additionally, users should be educated about the implications of using `setApprovalForAll`.
