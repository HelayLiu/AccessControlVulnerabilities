Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, I have identified the following potential access control issues:

1. **Function `sync_ledger` (line 139-160)**
   - **Reason**: The `sync_ledger` function is publicly accessible and can be called by any whitelisted lending market. However, there is no additional access control to ensure that the function is called only by authorized entities within the lending market. This could potentially allow any whitelisted market to manipulate the ledger for any lender, which might not be the intended behavior.

2. **Function `claim` (line 178-211)**
   - **Reason**: The `claim` function allows any user to claim rewards for a given market. While it checks if the user has deposits, it does not verify if the user is authorized to claim rewards for the specified epochs. This could potentially allow users to claim rewards for epochs they are not entitled to, especially if there are any discrepancies in the `userClaimedEpoch` mapping.

3. **Function `checkpoint_market` (line 123-130)**
   - **Reason**: The `checkpoint_market` function is publicly accessible and can be called by any external entity. While it requires that there are deposits for the market, it does not restrict who can trigger this checkpoint. This could lead to unnecessary gas consumption if called repeatedly by unauthorized users.

4. **Function `checkpoint_lender` (line 134-138)**
   - **Reason**: Similar to `checkpoint_market`, the `checkpoint_lender` function is publicly accessible and can be called by any external entity. It does not restrict who can trigger this checkpoint for a specific lender, which could lead to unnecessary gas consumption if called repeatedly by unauthorized users.

**Proof of Concept for `sync_ledger` Issue:**

To demonstrate the potential issue with the `sync_ledger` function, consider the following scenario:

- Assume there are two whitelisted lending markets, `MarketA` and `MarketB`.
- A malicious actor controls `MarketB` and calls `sync_ledger` with a large positive `_delta` for a lender in `MarketA`.
- This would incorrectly update the lender's balance in `MarketA`, potentially leading to incorrect reward calculations.

**Output:**

1. Function `sync_ledger` (line 139-160) has the access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any whitelisted market without verifying the caller's authority within the market, allowing potential manipulation of lender balances.

2. Function `claim` (line 178-211) has the access control issues. Reason: The function allows users to claim rewards for epochs without verifying their entitlement, potentially leading to unauthorized reward claims.

3. Function `checkpoint_market` (line 123-130) has the access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any external entity without restriction, leading to potential unnecessary gas consumption.

4. Function `checkpoint_lender` (line 134-138) has the access control issues. Reason: The function can be called by any external entity without restriction, leading to potential unnecessary gas consumption.
