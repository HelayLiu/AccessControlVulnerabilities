Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, the following access control issues have been identified:

1. **Function `performUpkeep()` (line 211-246)**
   - **Reason**: The `performUpkeep()` function is publicly accessible and can be called by any address. Although it uses a `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent reentrancy attacks, it does not have any access control checks to restrict who can call it. This function orchestrates a series of critical operations, including token swaps, reward distributions, and protocol-owned liquidity management. Without proper access control, any external user can trigger these operations, potentially leading to unintended consequences or exploitation.

2. **Function `currentRewardsForCallingPerformUpkeep()` (line 249-255)**
   - **Reason**: While this function is a view function and does not modify the state, it provides information about the rewards available for calling `performUpkeep()`. This could be used by potential attackers to time their calls to `performUpkeep()` for maximum profit. Although not a direct access control issue, it highlights the importance of ensuring that the `performUpkeep()` function is properly secured.

**Proof of Concept for `performUpkeep()` Access Control Issue:**

To demonstrate the access control issue with `performUpkeep()`, consider the following scenario:

1. An attacker observes that the `performUpkeep()` function is publicly accessible.
2. The attacker calls `performUpkeep()` repeatedly, potentially manipulating the timing to maximize their rewards from the arbitrage profits and other distributions.
3. This could lead to the attacker draining rewards or causing disruptions in the intended operation of the contract.

**Recommendation:**

To mitigate these issues, it is recommended to implement access control mechanisms, such as an `onlyAuthorized` modifier, to restrict access to the `performUpkeep()` function. This could involve maintaining a list of authorized addresses or roles that are permitted to call this function, ensuring that only trusted entities can perform these critical operations.
