1. Function `addGlobalToken` (line 28-42) has an access control issue. Reason: This function is public and can be called by any external account. It allows the caller to initiate a cross-chain request to add a global token, which could have significant implications on the system's state and operations. There is no access control modifier to restrict this function to authorized users only.

2. Function `addLocalToken` (line 44-57) has an access control issue. Reason: Similar to `addGlobalToken`, this function is public and can be called by any external account. It allows the caller to add a local token to the system, which could affect the system's token management. There is no access control mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can perform this action.

3. Function `anyExecuteNoSettlement` (line 144-198) has an access control issue. Reason: This function is marked as `external` and can be called by any external account. It processes various operations based on the input data, including adding global tokens, adding bridge agents, and managing strategies. The function relies on the `requiresAgentExecutor` modifier for access control, but the implementation of this modifier is not provided in the contract, making it unclear if proper access control is enforced.
