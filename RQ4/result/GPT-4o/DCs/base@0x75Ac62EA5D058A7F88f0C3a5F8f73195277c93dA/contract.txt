The provided contract does not contain any access control issues. The contract uses the `Ownable` pattern from OpenZeppelin, which ensures that only the owner can call certain functions. The functions `open` and `close` are protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring that only the contract owner can change the state of the `_opened` variable. Additionally, the constructor sets the initial owner, and the `transferOwnership` function is properly restricted to the current owner.

All other functions either do not modify state variables or are protected by the `nonReentrant` modifier, which prevents reentrancy attacks. The contract also correctly implements the ERC1155 and ERC721 receiver interfaces, ensuring that only tokens from the specified contracts can be processed.

Therefore, there are no access control vulnerabilities in this contract.
