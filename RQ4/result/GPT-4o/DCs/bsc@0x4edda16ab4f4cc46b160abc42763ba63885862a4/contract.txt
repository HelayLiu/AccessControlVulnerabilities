After analyzing the provided smart contract, here are the potential access control issues identified:

1. **Function `constructor` (line 98-122)**:
   - **Reason**: The constructor sets the initial roles and fee recipient to `msg.sender`. If the contract is deployed by an unintended account, it could lead to unauthorized access and control over the contract's critical functions. The initial setup should ensure that only a trusted account can deploy the contract.

2. **Function `rotationSwaps` (line 144-184)**:
   - **Reason**: This function is restricted to the `ROTATOR` role, which is correctly implemented. However, if the role management in `DefaultAccess` is not properly secured, unauthorized users could potentially gain this role and execute swaps, affecting the contract's asset management.

3. **Function `collectFee` (line 188-202)**:
   - **Reason**: This function is restricted to the `OPERATOR` role. Similar to the `ROTATOR` role, if the role management is not secure, unauthorized users could collect fees, leading to potential financial loss.

4. **Function `approveAsset` (line 206-211)**:
   - **Reason**: This function allows the `OPERATOR` to approve asset spending. If the `OPERATOR` role is compromised, it could lead to unauthorized approvals and potential asset mismanagement.

5. **Function `updateDiscountPolicy` (line 215-219)**:
   - **Reason**: This function allows the `OPERATOR` to update the discount policy. If the `OPERATOR` role is compromised, it could lead to setting a malicious discount policy, affecting the contract's fee structure.

6. **Function `updateFeeDetails` (line 223-243)**:
   - **Reason**: This function allows the `OPERATOR` to update fee details. If the `OPERATOR` role is compromised, it could lead to setting unfavorable fee percentages and recipients, affecting users' transactions.

7. **Function `updateMaxAssets` (line 247-252)**:
   - **Reason**: This function allows the `OPERATOR` to update the maximum number of assets. If the `OPERATOR` role is compromised, it could lead to setting an inappropriate limit, affecting the contract's asset management.

8. **Function `updateSlippageTolerance` (line 256-262)**:
   - **Reason**: This function allows the `OPERATOR` to update slippage tolerances. If the `OPERATOR` role is compromised, it could lead to setting inappropriate slippage limits, affecting transaction execution.

9. **Function `addDepositableAsset` (line 266-277)**:
   - **Reason**: This function allows the `OPERATOR` to add depositable assets. If the `OPERATOR` role is compromised, it could lead to adding unsupported or malicious assets, affecting the contract's integrity.

10. **Function `removeDepositableAsset` (line 281-289)**:
    - **Reason**: This function allows the `OPERATOR` to remove depositable assets. If the `OPERATOR` role is compromised, it could lead to removing critical assets, affecting the contract's functionality.

11. **Function `updateOracle` (line 294-299)**:
    - **Reason**: This function allows the `ORACLE_MGR` to update the oracle address. If the `ORACLE_MGR` role is compromised, it could lead to setting a malicious oracle, affecting price feeds and contract operations.

**Proof of Concept**: To verify these issues, one would need to check the implementation of the `DefaultAccess` contract to ensure that role assignments and checks are properly secured. Additionally, testing should be conducted to ensure that only authorized accounts can perform actions restricted by roles.
