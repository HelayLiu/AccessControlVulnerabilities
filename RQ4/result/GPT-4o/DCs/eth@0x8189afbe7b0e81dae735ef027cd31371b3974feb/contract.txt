Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, I have identified the following potential access control issues:

1. **Function `claim()` (line 45-95):**
   - **Reason:** The `claim()` function allows any user to execute it, provided they meet the conditions within the function. However, it does not have any access control modifiers like `onlyOwner` or any other role-based access control. This function involves transferring tokens from the contract to the caller, which could be a significant operation. If the signature verification or other checks are bypassed or incorrectly implemented, it could lead to unauthorized token claims.

2. **Function `setSignatureManager()` (line 115-117):**
   - **Reason:** Although this function is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, it is crucial to highlight its importance. Changing the `signatureManager` can have significant implications on the security of the `claim()` function, as it relies on the `signatureManager` for signature verification. If the ownership of the contract is compromised, an attacker could set a malicious `signatureManager` and potentially exploit the `claim()` function.

3. **Function `setContractSupports()` (line 105-110):**
   - **Reason:** This function is also protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, but it is important to note that it allows the owner to modify the `contractSupports` mapping. This mapping is used in the `claim()` function to verify supported contracts. If the owner account is compromised, an attacker could add malicious contracts to this list, potentially leading to unauthorized claims.

**Proof of Concept for `claim()` Function:**

To demonstrate the potential issue with the `claim()` function, consider the following scenario:

- An attacker could attempt to exploit any weaknesses in the signature verification process. If they can generate a valid signature or find a way to bypass the signature check, they could call the `claim()` function and transfer tokens to themselves without proper authorization.

- Additionally, if there are any vulnerabilities in the NFT ownership checks (e.g., if the `IERC721` implementation is flawed or if there are reentrancy issues), an attacker could exploit these to claim tokens without actually owning the required NFTs.

**Conclusion:**

While the contract has implemented some access control measures using the `onlyOwner` modifier, it is crucial to ensure that the `claim()` function's logic is robust and that the signature verification process is secure. Additionally, maintaining the security of the owner account is vital to prevent unauthorized changes to critical contract parameters.
