1. Function `_initialize` (line 66-74) has a potential access control issue. Reason: The `_initialize` function is marked as `public` and `onlyInitializing`, which means it can be called by any address during the initialization phase. This could potentially allow unauthorized users to initialize the contract with arbitrary values if the contract is not properly deployed and initialized by the owner.

2. Function `updateMappings` (line 184-203) has an access control issue. Reason: The `updateMappings` function is marked as `external` and `onlyOwner`, which means it can only be called by the owner. However, the function allows the owner to update critical mappings like `userRewardsOfInvestedProtocols` and `userRewardPerTokenPaidPointerMapping` with arbitrary values. This could potentially lead to manipulation of user rewards if the owner account is compromised.

3. Function `rescueFunds` (line 396-400) has an access control issue. Reason: The `rescueFunds` function is marked as `external` and `onlyOwner`, which means it can only be called by the owner. However, it allows the owner to transfer any ERC20 tokens from the contract to the owner's address. This could potentially lead to loss of funds if the owner account is compromised.

4. Function `rescueETH` (line 402-405) has an access control issue. Reason: The `rescueETH` function is marked as `external` and `onlyOwner`, which means it can only be called by the owner. However, it allows the owner to transfer any ETH from the contract to the owner's address. This could potentially lead to loss of funds if the owner account is compromised.

5. Function `rescueFundsWithHexData` (line 407-416) has an access control issue. Reason: The `rescueFundsWithHexData` function is marked as `external` and `onlyOwner`, which means it can only be called by the owner. However, it allows the owner to transfer any ETH from the contract to any address with arbitrary data. This could potentially lead to loss of funds if the owner account is compromised.
