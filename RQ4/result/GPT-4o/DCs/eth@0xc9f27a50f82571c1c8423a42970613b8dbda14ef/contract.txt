OutPut:
1. Function `deposit` (line 38-63) has a potential access control issue. Reason: The function allows any external caller to deposit VISR tokens and mint vVISR tokens without any access control checks. This could be exploited by unauthorized users to mint vVISR tokens, potentially leading to inflation or misuse of the token supply.

2. Function `withdraw` (line 65-85) has a potential access control issue. Reason: The function allows any external caller to withdraw VISR tokens by burning vVISR tokens without any access control checks. Although there is a check to ensure the sender owns the tokens, the function can still be called by anyone, which might lead to unauthorized withdrawals if the ownership check is bypassed or manipulated.

3. Function `transferOwnership` (line 95-97) has an access control issue. Reason: While it is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, the function does not check if the `newOwner` address is valid (e.g., not a zero address). This could lead to a loss of control over the contract if the ownership is transferred to an invalid address.

4. Function `transferTokenOwnership` (line 99-101) has an access control issue. Reason: Similar to `transferOwnership`, this function does not validate the `newOwner` address, which could result in the loss of control over the vVISR token contract if transferred to an invalid address.
