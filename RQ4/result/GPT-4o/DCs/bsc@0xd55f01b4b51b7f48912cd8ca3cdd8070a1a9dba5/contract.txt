OutPut:
1. Function setOracleData(address rToken, oracleChainlink _oracle) (line 21-23) has the access control issues. Reason: The setOracleData function is publicly accessible and allows anyone to set or update the oracle data for any rToken. This can lead to manipulation of oracle data, which can affect the price feeds and potentially lead to incorrect pricing information being used in the contract. This function should be restricted to only allow authorized users, such as the contract owner or an admin, to update oracle data.
