OutPut:
1. Function `owned()` (line 16-18) has the access control issues. Reason: The `owned()` function can change the `owner` variable to any arbitrary address that calls it. This is significant because the `owner` has special privileges in the contract, such as freezing accounts, burning tokens, and minting new tokens. Without proper access control, any user can become the owner and exploit these privileges.

Proof of Concept:
- Deploy the contract.
- Call the `owned()` function from an address other than the deployer.
- Verify that the `owner` variable has been changed to the address that called `owned()`.
