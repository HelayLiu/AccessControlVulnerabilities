1. Function `transferOwnership(address newOwner)` (line 108-112) has an access control issue. Reason: The function is public and does not have the `onlyOwner` modifier, allowing any user to change the contract's owner to any address, which can lead to unauthorized control over the contract.

2. Function `unlock()` (line 132-137) has an access control issue. Reason: The function allows the `_previousOwner` to regain ownership after the lock period without any additional checks. If `_previousOwner` is compromised or if the lock mechanism is not properly managed, it could lead to unauthorized access.

Proof of Concept for `transferOwnership`:
- Deploy the contract.
- Call `transferOwnership` with a new address as a parameter from any account.
- Observe that the owner of the contract changes to the new address without any restriction.

Proof of Concept for `unlock`:
- Deploy the contract and lock the ownership using the `lock` function.
- Wait for the lock period to expire.
- Call `unlock` from the `_previousOwner` address.
- Observe that the ownership is transferred back to `_previousOwner` without any additional checks.
