1. Function `setOwner(address _owner)` (line 23-26) has an access control issue. Reason: The `setOwner` function is public and allows anyone to change the owner of the contract without any restriction. This is a critical vulnerability as it allows unauthorized users to take control of the contract.

2. Function `uploadBalances(address[] addresses, uint256[] balances)` (line 78-89) has an access control issue. Reason: Although it uses the `onlyOwner` modifier, it does not check if the sum of the new balances exceeds the total supply. This could potentially allow the owner to manipulate balances in a way that exceeds the total supply, which could be a security risk.

3. Function `transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount)` (line 98-116) and `transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount)` (line 122-141) have an access control issue. Reason: These functions do not have any access control checks to prevent unauthorized transfers when the `locked` variable is set to `false`. This could allow unauthorized users to transfer tokens if the contract is unlocked.

4. Function `approveAndCall(address _spender, uint256 _amount, bytes _extraData)` (line 147-153) has an access control issue. Reason: This function allows the execution of arbitrary code in the `receiveApproval` function of the `_spender` contract, which could be exploited if the `_spender` contract is malicious.

5. Function `unlockToken()` (line 198-200) has an access control issue. Reason: Although it uses the `onlyOwner` modifier, unlocking the token without proper checks or conditions could lead to unauthorized transfers if the contract is not intended to be unlocked at that time.
