OutPut:
1. Function onlyOwner() (line 47-51) has an access control issue. Reason: The modifier `onlyOwner` is intended to restrict access to certain functions to only the contract owner. However, the condition `require(msg.sender != owner);` is incorrect and allows anyone except the owner to execute the functions protected by this modifier. This is a logical error that effectively negates the intended access control.

Proof of Concept:
To verify this issue, you can create a function in the contract that uses the `onlyOwner` modifier and attempt to call it with an account that is not the owner. The function will execute successfully, demonstrating the access control issue.

```solidity
function restrictedFunction() public onlyOwner returns (bool) {
    // Some restricted logic
    return true;
}
```

Test:
1. Deploy the contract with an account (let's call it Account A).
2. Attempt to call `restrictedFunction()` with a different account (Account B).
3. The function will execute successfully, indicating that the access control is not functioning as intended.
