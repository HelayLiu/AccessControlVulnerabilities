1. Function `changeNodePrice(uint256 newNodePrice)` (line 366-368) has an access control issue. Reason: The function is public and allows anyone to change the `nodePrice` without any access control checks. This could lead to unauthorized changes to the node price, affecting the economic model of the contract.

2. Function `changeRewardPerNode(uint256 _rewardPerDay)` (line 370-372) has an access control issue. Reason: The function is public and allows anyone to change the `rewardPerDay` without any access control checks. This could lead to unauthorized changes to the reward distribution, affecting the contract's reward system.

Proof of Concept:
- Deploy the contract.
- Call `changeNodePrice` with a new value as any address other than the owner.
- Observe that the `nodePrice` is updated without any restriction.
- Similarly, call `changeRewardPerNode` with a new value as any address other than the owner.
- Observe that the `rewardPerDay` is updated without any restriction.
