The provided contract is quite extensive and includes multiple components such as libraries, interfaces, and two main contracts: `NovoNFT` and `NOVO`. Let's analyze the access control issues:

1. **Function `mint` in `NovoNFT` (line 101-118):**
   - **Reason:** The `mint` function allows any user to mint new NFTs as long as they meet the conditions specified (e.g., `balanceOf(msg.sender) == 0`). However, there is no restriction on who can call this function, which means anyone can mint NFTs without any specific access control. This could lead to abuse if not intended to be open to all users.

2. **Function `mintForStakingV1ByOwner` in `NovoNFT` (line 120-137):**
   - **Reason:** This function is restricted by the `onlyOwner` modifier, which is appropriate. However, it allows the owner to mint NFTs and transfer tokens from a specified address (`_stakingV1`) to another address (`_stakerAddress`). This could be a potential issue if the owner is compromised or acts maliciously, as they could drain tokens from the `_stakingV1` address.

3. **Function `setNovoNFTAddress` in `NOVO` (line 1080-1082):**
   - **Reason:** This function allows the owner to set the address of the `NovoNFT` contract. While it is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, changing the `NovoNFT` address could have significant implications on the contract's behavior, especially if the new address is not a legitimate `NovoNFT` contract.

4. **Function `setTreasuryAddress` in `NOVO` (line 1000-1002):**
   - **Reason:** This function allows the owner to change the treasury address. Although it is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, changing the treasury address can redirect funds to an unintended address if the owner is compromised.

5. **Function `setStakingPoolAddress` in `NOVO` (line 1004-1006):**
   - **Reason:** Similar to the `setTreasuryAddress` function, this allows the owner to change the staking pool address, which could redirect staking rewards to an unintended address.

6. **Function `blacklistAddress` in `NOVO` (line 1040-1043):**
   - **Reason:** This function allows the owner to blacklist any address, preventing it from participating in token transfers. While this can be a useful feature for security, it also gives the owner significant power to restrict users arbitrarily.

7. **Function `unBlacklistAddress` in `NOVO` (line 1045-1047):**
   - **Reason:** This function allows the owner to remove an address from the blacklist. Similar to `blacklistAddress`, it gives the owner significant control over user participation.

8. **Function `allowtrading` in `NOVO` (line 986-989):**
   - **Reason:** This function allows the owner to enable trading. Until this function is called, only the owner can trade or add liquidity. This centralizes control over when the token can be traded.

**Proof of Concept:**
To verify these issues, you can deploy the contract and attempt to call the `mint` function from any address to see if it allows unrestricted minting. Similarly, you can test the owner-restricted functions by attempting to call them from a non-owner address to ensure they are properly restricted.

**Output:**
1. Function `mint` in `NovoNFT` (line 101-118) has access control issues. Reason: It allows any user to mint new NFTs without specific access control, potentially leading to abuse.
2. Function `mintForStakingV1ByOwner` in `NovoNFT` (line 120-137) has access control issues. Reason: The owner can mint NFTs and transfer tokens from a specified address, which could be abused if the owner is compromised.
3. Function `setNovoNFTAddress` in `NOVO` (line 1080-1082) has access control issues. Reason: Changing the `NovoNFT` address can significantly alter contract behavior.
4. Function `setTreasuryAddress` in `NOVO` (line 1000-1002) has access control issues. Reason: Changing the treasury address can redirect funds to an unintended address.
5. Function `setStakingPoolAddress` in `NOVO` (line 1004-1006) has access control issues. Reason: Changing the staking pool address can redirect staking rewards to an unintended address.
6. Function `blacklistAddress` in `NOVO` (line 1040-1043) has access control issues. Reason: The owner can arbitrarily restrict user participation by blacklisting addresses.
7. Function `unBlacklistAddress` in `NOVO` (line 1045-1047) has access control issues. Reason: The owner can arbitrarily allow user participation by unblacklisting addresses.
8. Function `allowtrading` in `NOVO` (line 986-989) has access control issues. Reason: The owner controls when the token can be traded, centralizing control.
