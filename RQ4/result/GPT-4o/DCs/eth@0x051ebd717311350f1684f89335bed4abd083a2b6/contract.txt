OutPut:
1. Function `initOwner(address newOwner)` (line 38-41) has an access control issue. Reason: The `initOwner` function can be called by anyone to set the initial owner of the contract, as it lacks any access control modifiers. This is significant because it allows any user to become the owner of the contract if it hasn't been initialized yet.

2. Function `claimOwnership()` (line 50-55) has an access control issue. Reason: The `claimOwnership` function allows the `_NEW_OWNER_` to claim ownership without any restrictions on who can set `_NEW_OWNER_`. This means that if `transferOwnership` is called by the current owner to set `_NEW_OWNER_`, anyone with access to the `_NEW_OWNER_` address can claim ownership, potentially leading to unauthorized ownership transfer.

Proof of Concept for `initOwner`:
- Deploy the `InitializableOwnable` contract.
- Call `initOwner` with any address as `newOwner`.
- Verify that the `_OWNER_` is set to the `newOwner` address provided, demonstrating that anyone can initialize the owner.

Proof of Concept for `claimOwnership`:
- Assume the current owner calls `transferOwnership` to set `_NEW_OWNER_`.
- The address set as `_NEW_OWNER_` calls `claimOwnership`.
- Verify that the `_OWNER_` is updated to `_NEW_OWNER_`, demonstrating that ownership can be claimed by anyone with access to the `_NEW_OWNER_` address.
