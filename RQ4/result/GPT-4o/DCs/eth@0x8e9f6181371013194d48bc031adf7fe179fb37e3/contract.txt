1. **Function ToOwner() (line 66-69)** has the access control issues. 
   - **Reason**: The `ToOwner()` function allows any caller to set themselves as the owner of the contract. This is a significant security risk as it allows anyone to take control of the contract and perform any owner-restricted actions.

2. **Function Mining24() (line 70-74)** has the access control issues.
   - **Reason**: Similar to `ToOwner()`, the `Mining24()` function allows any caller to set themselves as the owner of the contract. This function also sets the `value` and `minReq` variables, which could affect the distribution logic.

**Proof of Concept**:
- Deploy the contract.
- Call the `ToOwner()` function from an address other than the deployer.
- Verify that the caller's address is now the owner of the contract.
- Call the `Mining24()` function from another address and verify that the caller's address is now the owner of the contract.

These functions should be restricted to the current owner to prevent unauthorized access and control over the contract.
