OutPut:
1. Function EAI_TokenERC20 (line 25-32) has the access control issues. Reason: The constructor function EAI_TokenERC20 initializes the total supply and assigns all tokens to the creator of the contract. However, there is no access control mechanism to restrict who can call this function. In Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0, if the function name matches the contract name, it is considered a constructor. However, if the function name does not match the contract name exactly, it can be called by anyone, allowing them to reinitialize the contract state. This is a potential vulnerability if the contract is deployed with a different name or if the function is mistakenly not recognized as a constructor.
