Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, I have identified a potential access control issue:

1. **Function `depositFor` (line 451-466)** has an access control issue. 
   - **Reason**: The `depositFor` function allows any caller to deposit tokens on behalf of any user without any access control checks. This means that any address can call this function and specify any user address to mint shares for, which could lead to unauthorized minting of shares for users who did not intend to deposit tokens. This function should include access control checks to ensure that only authorized entities can perform deposits on behalf of other users.
