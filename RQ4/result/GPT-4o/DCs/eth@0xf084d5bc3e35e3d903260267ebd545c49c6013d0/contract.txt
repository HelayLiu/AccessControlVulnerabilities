OutPut:
1. Function `DimonCoin()` (line 19-22) has the access control issues. Reason: The constructor function `DimonCoin()` can change the `owner` variable, which is significant because with the role, the owner can perform privileged operations on the contract. However, this is a constructor and is only called once during deployment, so it is not a vulnerability in practice.

2. Function `transferOwnership(address newOwner)` (line 28-30) has the access control issues. Reason: Although it uses the `onlyOwner` modifier, it does not check if `newOwner` is a valid address (e.g., not zero address). This could lead to loss of control over the contract if the ownership is transferred to an invalid address.

3. Function `withdrawForeignTokens(address _tokenContract)` (line 79-84) has the access control issues. Reason: The function uses a direct `require(msg.sender == owner)` check instead of the `onlyOwner` modifier, which is inconsistent with the rest of the contract. This inconsistency could lead to potential errors or oversight in access control management.
