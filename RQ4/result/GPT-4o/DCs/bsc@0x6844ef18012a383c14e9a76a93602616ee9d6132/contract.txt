Upon reviewing the provided smart contract, I have identified a potential access control issue:

1. **Function `setSwapPairs` (line 204-206)** has an access control issue. 
   - **Reason**: The function `setSwapPairs` is intended to set swap pairs by modifying the `Pairs` mapping. However, it lacks the `onlyOwner` modifier, which means that any address can call this function and modify the swap pairs. This could lead to unauthorized entities setting swap pairs, potentially affecting the contract's behavior and security.

To verify this issue, a proof of concept can be created where an arbitrary address calls the `setSwapPairs` function to modify the `Pairs` mapping, demonstrating that the function can be accessed without any restrictions. This could be exploited to manipulate the contract's logic related to swap pairs.
